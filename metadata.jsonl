She's answering common facial-filler questions and performing full-face rejuvenations on two of her clients. Filler is a volume inducer, mostly made out of hyaluronic acid, that helps add volume to areas that are shifting downwards because of aging. Common areas patients request are the eyes, cheeks, and lips. However, fillers can also be placed on the chin, jawline, and around the nose. \n\nClients can see a difference immediately after receiving filler, but fully healed results show in about two weeks. One syringe of filler typically costs about $500 to $1,000, and results can last a year to two years. If someone is doing a full facial lift with fillers, such as a combination of the under eyes, cheeks, lips, nasolabial folds, and jawline, that can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $10,000, and those results can last three to four years. If a client isn't happy with their results, hyaluronic acid fillers can be completely dissolved. It's important to visit a professional who will understand your face shape, ethnicity, mental and physical health concerns, and what to do if a treatment has complications.\n\nFor more, please visit Vanessa Lee:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/vanessalee_rn/\nThe Things We Do:\nhttps://thethingswedo.co/. \n\nMORE BEAUTY INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Medical Pedicures Transform Feet\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHuvDvCkbC0&t=13s\n11 Grossly Satisfying Beauty Treatments For Better Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pdzwgKFHI\nHow A Nonsurgical Face-Lift Works | Beauty Explorers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot_2tuwRR2U\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Fillers #BeautyTransformations #BeautyInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

The desire for community and purpose will always find a way even if it's in the form of a summer work program. It is even more powerful when paired with the poetry of passionate teens.  \n\nDenise Fellows, prior to SummerWorks, referred to herself as a ‚Äúsilent poet.‚Äù She said that her poetry used to ‚Äòscream so loud to be heard by someone other than her own ears.‚Äô Denise worked with SummerWorks in the summer of 2014, and it was there she began sharing her work.\n\nKira Cobbs was born in 1998 in Denver, CO. She plays the piano and practices Chinese and sign language; she also participates in her school‚Äôs poetry organization, Louder Than a Bomb. She has been writing poetry since she was inspired to do so by her fourth grade teacher.

It was an amazing experience and opportunity.‚Äù \r\n\r\nJasmine would like to thank her 7th grade teacher, Ms. Carlson of Monroe Middle School, for introducing her to poetry. Jasmine says poetry is the reasons she is the person she is today; it has helped her through anger, depression, and other life struggles.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The results were compared with those obtained in men during continuous sleep. Although mean levels and area under the curve of testosterone were similar in both groups, fragmented sleep resulted in a significant delay in testosterone rise (03:24 h ¬± 1:13 vs. 22:35 h ¬± 0:22)\nDuring fragmented sleep, nocturnal testosterone rise was observed only in subjects who showed REM episodes (4/10) - findings indicate that the sleep-related rise in serum testosterone levels is linked with the appearance of first REM sleep. The rise in testosterone levels was slower when REM latency was longer in young adult men, testosterone levels begin to rise on falling asleep, peak at about the time of first REM, and remain at the same levels until awakening.\n\nMorning vs Evening Workouts Study - Study - journal PLoS One:\nLooked at the effect of time of day on performance, hormonal and metabolic response during a 1000-M cycling time trial in 9 recreational cyclists, average age 31. The participants performed a 1000-m TT at either 8 am or 6 pm, in randomized, repeated-measures, crossover design a 1000-m cycling time-trial. The time to complete the time trial was lower in the evening than in the morning (88.2 vs 94.7, respectively), but there was no significant different in pacing. However, oxygen uptake and aerobic mechanical power output at 600 and 1000 m tended to be higher in the evening. There was also a main effect of time of day for insulin, cortisol, and total and free testosterone concentration, which were all higher in the morning (+60%, +26%, +31% and +22%, respectively) The norepinephrine response to the exercise was increased in the morning (+46%), and it was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in the response of glucose.\n\nReferences:\n\n1) The Effect of Diurnal Variation on Clinical Measurement of Serum Testosterone and Other Sex Hormone Levels in Men.

They can also help with asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Purchase a high altitude training mask here: https://amzn.to/2VWcevd (affiliate link) NOTE: This is not the unit I used in the video. That one is no longer available.\n\nThese types of breathing exercises can give improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance and exercise performance. \n\nInspiratory muscle training is basically a series of breathing exercises that aim to strengthen the bodies‚Äô respiratory muscles making it easier for people to breathe. When a person is breathing normally, they typically use between 10 to 15 per cent of his or her total lung capacity. However, with Inspiratory muscle training, a person can typically increase the amount of lung capacity used. \n\nA tool that can help with inspiratory muscle training is a high altitude training mask like the one from Perpetual Air featured in the video. These masks restrict air flow and can help with inspiratory muscle training. The Perpetual Air mask has various levels of air restriction that are easily adjusted.\n\nThe following exercises can be done either with our without a high altitude training mask.\n\nThe first breathing exercise is very simple. Breath in through your nose for 2 seconds and breath out through your mouth with pursed lips for 4 seconds. \n\nNow you are going to move your arms with the breathing to loosen up the muscles around your chest area. \n\nFinally, breathing with your diaphragm, or belly breathing, is a great way to relax and improve your breathing.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nBreathing Exercises for Relaxation or COPD:\nhttps://youtu.be/-7-CAFhJn78\n\n===========================================\n\nSUPPORT me on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo\n\n===========================================\n\nBreathing Exercises for COPD, Asthma, Bronchitis & Emphysema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpTNUGwXbTU\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.

Some MCU actors like Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd were far from ripped and muscular when they were cast in their respective roles. However, they put in the work to attain the fit and athletic bodies they sport on screen. This is no easy feat, as getting your body into peak shape is an incredibly difficult task. Sometimes it take‚Äôs over a year of strict dieting and workout plans to achieve their goals. And then years more maintaining this shape for future movies in the MCU. Luckily for them, they are provided with top of the line trainers and dieticians that help them along their journey. This definitely helps, but it‚Äôs still on the actors to apply themselves to the regimes assigned. Which actors had difficulties maintaining their diets?\nSometimes the trainers used by these actors are actually good friends with them, as is the case with Chris Hemsworth, who has known his trainer since he was four years old.\n\nAll those muscles aren‚Äôt just for show, and these actors have done some seriously impressive things.

As we get older, our testosterone tends to naturally decline. We can‚Äôt stop it completely, but we can fight back against the loss of our needed male hormones. Having less fat and more muscle is crucial for our testosterone production. When you think of building muscle, you think of resistance training and lifting weights at the gym or at home. While that is the major key for building muscle, there are some needs you need to fo to help optimize muscle growth.\n\nAside from resistance training, there are 2 more major keys for building muscle faster after 50. Recovery and getting good quality sleep is another crucial part for building muscle. That is the time when your body works on repairing the muscle fibers you damage from your workouts, helping them grow bigger during the recovery. \n\nThe last major component is nutrition. In order to build more muscle, you need to make sure that you are consuming enough protein. Protein is the most needed food group in order to build more muscle during your recovery from your workouts. There are a lot of foods you can eat, supplements you can, protein powder you can drink to get protein in your body. That is why I am going to give you 5 great foods that you can eat to help you build more muscle faster after 50.\n\nHere are the 5 foods to help you build muscle faster after 50.

Or in other words, simply figuring out how you‚Äôre going to group your exercises throughout the week. And although there isn‚Äôt one ‚Äúbest workout split‚Äù for everyone, certain muscle building splits have their advantages. For example, we know that training a muscle at least 2x/week is superior to 1x/week. This automatically makes the common bro split inferior to other higher muscle training frequency workout splits. Training splits like the upper lower split, full body workout splits (‚Äútotal body workouts‚Äù), and the push pull legs workout split train each muscle 2x/week whereas the bro split does not. This not only helps better optimize protein synthesis but also enables you to get more quality sets done since your workout volume is spread out over multiple workouts.\n\nBut which of these splits should you choose for mass? Well, it depends on your training experience. The best workout split for beginners looking to put on mass is likely a 3 day workout split with full body workouts. This is because you can train the compound lifts frequently and master them very quickly without causing too much muscle damage. Then, as you gain experience and need more volume to progress, you can switch to a 4 day workout split (such as the upper/lower split) to help spread out your volume better throughout the week. And then, as you progress even more, switching to a 5 day workout split or a 6 day workout split (push pull legs for example) would be wise to keep your workouts from being excessively long and fatiguing. However, despite what research says, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that workout volume and consistency are the more important factors. So choose the workout split that you enjoy the most and best fits your schedule ‚Äì as that‚Äôs going to be the best option for you! \n\nAnd if you‚Äôre looking for a step-by-step program that shows you how to optimize your training and nutrition in order to progress as efficiently as possible, then simply take my starting-point analysis tool below to find which program is best for you: \nhttps://builtwithscience.com/bws-free-fitness-quiz/gender?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=Video&utm_content=Description%20box&utm_campaign=Science%20based%20back%20split%20to%20maximize%20growth%20Jan%206%2F2019\n\nLINK TO WRITTEN ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/best-workout-split/ \n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM & FACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeremyethier/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Jeremyethierfit/\n\nMUSIC:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\nSTUDIES:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729395\n\nOTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES:\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/frequency-muscle/\nhttps://mennohenselmans.com/optimal-program-design/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 427, "publish_time": "20190106"}

Doctor Wagner explains pre-workout supplements, best pre workout supplement, preworkout, pre-workout meal, pre-workout drink, pre-workout powder, how to take pre-workout, strongest pre-workout, homemade pre-work, and how to properly use it to boost performance, and more in this pre-workout review. Is choosing the best workout supplements the answer to how to build muscle fast and lose belly fat? Is pre-workout bad for you? Is it safe to take pre workout everyday? Questions about pre-workout backed by science are answered by a real doctor. Pre-workout supplements or pre-workouts are multi-ingredient dietary formulas designed to boost energy and athletic performance. They‚Äôre typically a powdered substance that you mix in water and drink before exercise. Ingredients typically will include amino acids BCAAs, B vitamins, caffeine, creatine, nitric oxide precursors, L-arginine, L-citrulline, and artificial sweeteners are often included. Have you pre-workouts such as C4 or any other brands? What has your pre-workout experience been?

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nThe success of Joker and Venom has completely changed the way movie studios are looking at superhero movies. No longer are our caped heroes standing front and center. With Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad coming soon, we could see a whole slate of super-villain movies hitting the big screen. Why bother trying another stab at remaking the Fantastic Four when there‚Äôs such a better character to focus on instead? Doctor Doom stood in the shadows of both Fantastic Four franchises, serving as the main villain, but not getting fleshed out enough to truly becoming a compelling part of the films. Catwoman had her shot at a solo movie with Halle Berry‚Äôs disappointing cheesefest back in 2004, but there‚Äôs another DC vixen who could really shine with a solo story -- and her name is Poison Ivy. Just the thought of Poison Ivy on the big screen has probably conjured some pretty bad memories of Batman and Robin, but let‚Äôs just pull that withered weed from the garden and start over. Despite the cheesy puns about ice, snow, and everything frozen, you cannot deny the dramatic possibilities of the Mr. Freeze origin story we saw glimpses of in the 1997 disaster Batman & Robin. Arnold Schawnegger‚Äôs portrayal of Mr. Freeze is pretty much a big joke now and has resulted in no other portrayals of the character on the big-screen, but he definitely has a great story to tell. \n\nThe Joker did a deep dive into the character‚Äôs psyche, backstory, and provided a whole new perspective on the madness behind him. But what other villains deserve a similar movie treatment? Between some Marvel juggernauts and DC villains who deserve proper big-screen treatment, let‚Äôs see who should go solo in the future!\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 635, "publish_time": "20191024"}

Initially I was a little apprehensive, worried that my drawing skills might have deteriorated during my time away.\n\nBut as I mention in the video, to my surprise they‚Äôd actually improved! I‚Äôm not sure what the exact reason behind this is, but I suspect that after getting some distance my brain had time to process everything I‚Äôd learned. So when I eventually started drawing again, it was all still there!\n\nI do feel like my work has a bit more rhythm to it now, which feels great. I‚Äôm not thinking about it, or judging it as much anymore. I‚Äôm not too concerned about the small things. The creation process seems to have become quite fluid for me as of recently and I‚Äôm thankful for that.\n\nThe idea for this character design sketch came about after I‚Äôd spent long enough thinking about an idea that had been fermenting inside my mind for the last few months. It was an idea for a comic book, and the more I thought about it, the more complete it became.\n\nEventually I‚Äôd somehow worked out an entire plot in my head without writing anything down at all, and at that point I figured hey, why not put pencil to paper and see if I can‚Äôt come up with a few cool character concepts for this story?\n\nThe character in this video is one of the key players in the plot. He works at a robotics plant where he manufactures bio mechanical replacement bodies for people to transfer their consciousness to when their organic bodies become obsolete. \n\nThe catch is that these body replacements, otherwise known as capsules, are reserved only for the wealthy and the powerful. \nSo of course this character, being a mere engineer at a manufacturing plant would never be able get his hands on one of these bio mechanical bodies, which is unfortunate for him because it just so happens that his younger brother is terminally ill with a rare disease that can‚Äôt be cured. \n\nHowever, he loves his brother and would do anything to save him ‚Äì so he does the unthinkable, illegally uploading his brothers consciousness into a capsule which does not belong to him.\n\nIn fact, this capsule has been set aside and belongs to one of the most powerful and feared gangsters in the entire city. And that‚Äôs just the beginning of the story! But I‚Äôll leave it there for now. I don‚Äôt want to give away too much just yet ‚Äì especially because I have no idea when I‚Äôll get round to actually putting this comic together!\n\nI hope you enjoy the video! \n\nThanks for watching! \n-Clayton\n\nSoftware Used: Manga Studio\n\nIf you like the video, show your support by commenting, sharing or subscribing. \n\nComic Art Community - https://www.howtodrawcomics.net/comic-art-community/\nHow to Draw Comics .NET - http://www.howtodrawcomics.net/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/howtodrawcomics/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/howtodrawcomics\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/howtodrawcomics\nTumblr - http://howtodrawcomics.tumblr.com/\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/howtodrawcomics/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1271, "publish_time": "20190409"}

Strangely satisfying", "description": "Chill out for 10 mins and let us do the work.\n\nI use timelapse filming mainly to prove to myself that at the end of the day I have actually done some work! Most of these shots cover several hours of digging condensed into just a matter of seconds- but when you're in the woods digging, especially if you're alone, progress can seem painfully slow sometimes! Making a big landing takes so much effort, the volume of dirt alone can mean hundreds, maybe thousands of wheelbarrows to fill, move and empty. \n\nI find that filming a timelapse stops me from getting lazy - if I stop digging to call or message someone it looks very obvious in the shot. You have to keep busy and keep moving. It's a good way of making sure you don't stop until the job is done. I generally set myself a target of something to achieve and then don't go home until it's done- even if it means getting lights out of my car and digging into the night. \n\nThis video is a mash-up of some of the timelapses I have shot over the last few years either of me alone (cheeky week day visits) or with the crew all digging together on Sunday. Even tho we're hopefully nearing the point when we can all return to our local trail spots- it's been weeks since I have ridden or done any digging. I plan to ease myself back into things and spend more time on a shovel than a bike for a while. \n\nReally hope you enjoy the video... Next week's video is a little different from the norm so look out for that one!\n\nTake it easy - oh yeah and subscribe ;-)", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 545, "publish_time": "20200515"}

You may use any brand you like but, most importantly for this technique, use 100% cotton. \n\nBrushes: I use a variety of brushes by different brands: Silver Brush, Chinese calligraphy brushes from Blue Heron Art and Michael Solovyev, squirrel brushes by Roubleff, synthetic by Escoda and Etchr, Aliexpress, and a few other different brands.

She's answering common facial-filler questions and performing full-face rejuvenations on two of her clients. Filler is a volume inducer, mostly made out of hyaluronic acid, that helps add volume to areas that are shifting downwards because of aging. Common areas patients request are the eyes, cheeks, and lips. However, fillers can also be placed on the chin, jawline, and around the nose. \n\nClients can see a difference immediately after receiving filler, but fully healed results show in about two weeks. One syringe of filler typically costs about $500 to $1,000, and results can last a year to two years. If someone is doing a full facial lift with fillers, such as a combination of the under eyes, cheeks, lips, nasolabial folds, and jawline, that can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $10,000, and those results can last three to four years. If a client isn't happy with their results, hyaluronic acid fillers can be completely dissolved. It's important to visit a professional who will understand your face shape, ethnicity, mental and physical health concerns, and what to do if a treatment has complications.\n\nFor more, please visit Vanessa Lee:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/vanessalee_rn/\nThe Things We Do:\nhttps://thethingswedo.co/. \n\nMORE BEAUTY INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Medical Pedicures Transform Feet\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHuvDvCkbC0&t=13s\n11 Grossly Satisfying Beauty Treatments For Better Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pdzwgKFHI\nHow A Nonsurgical Face-Lift Works | Beauty Explorers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot_2tuwRR2U\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Fillers #BeautyTransformations #BeautyInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

The results were compared with those obtained in men during continuous sleep. Although mean levels and area under the curve of testosterone were similar in both groups, fragmented sleep resulted in a significant delay in testosterone rise (03:24 h ¬± 1:13 vs. 22:35 h ¬± 0:22)\nDuring fragmented sleep, nocturnal testosterone rise was observed only in subjects who showed REM episodes (4/10) - findings indicate that the sleep-related rise in serum testosterone levels is linked with the appearance of first REM sleep. The rise in testosterone levels was slower when REM latency was longer in young adult men, testosterone levels begin to rise on falling asleep, peak at about the time of first REM, and remain at the same levels until awakening.\n\nMorning vs Evening Workouts Study - Study - journal PLoS One:\nLooked at the effect of time of day on performance, hormonal and metabolic response during a 1000-M cycling time trial in 9 recreational cyclists, average age 31. The participants performed a 1000-m TT at either 8 am or 6 pm, in randomized, repeated-measures, crossover design a 1000-m cycling time-trial. The time to complete the time trial was lower in the evening than in the morning (88.2 vs 94.7, respectively), but there was no significant different in pacing. However, oxygen uptake and aerobic mechanical power output at 600 and 1000 m tended to be higher in the evening. There was also a main effect of time of day for insulin, cortisol, and total and free testosterone concentration, which were all higher in the morning (+60%, +26%, +31% and +22%, respectively) The norepinephrine response to the exercise was increased in the morning (+46%), and it was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in the response of glucose.\n\nReferences:\n\n1) The Effect of Diurnal Variation on Clinical Measurement of Serum Testosterone and Other Sex Hormone Levels in Men.

They can also help with asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Purchase a high altitude training mask here: https://amzn.to/2VWcevd (affiliate link) NOTE: This is not the unit I used in the video. That one is no longer available.\n\nThese types of breathing exercises can give improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance and exercise performance. \n\nInspiratory muscle training is basically a series of breathing exercises that aim to strengthen the bodies‚Äô respiratory muscles making it easier for people to breathe. When a person is breathing normally, they typically use between 10 to 15 per cent of his or her total lung capacity. However, with Inspiratory muscle training, a person can typically increase the amount of lung capacity used. \n\nA tool that can help with inspiratory muscle training is a high altitude training mask like the one from Perpetual Air featured in the video. These masks restrict air flow and can help with inspiratory muscle training. The Perpetual Air mask has various levels of air restriction that are easily adjusted.\n\nThe following exercises can be done either with our without a high altitude training mask.\n\nThe first breathing exercise is very simple. Breath in through your nose for 2 seconds and breath out through your mouth with pursed lips for 4 seconds. \n\nNow you are going to move your arms with the breathing to loosen up the muscles around your chest area. \n\nFinally, breathing with your diaphragm, or belly breathing, is a great way to relax and improve your breathing.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nBreathing Exercises for Relaxation or COPD:\nhttps://youtu.be/-7-CAFhJn78\n\n===========================================\n\nSUPPORT me on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo\n\n===========================================\n\nBreathing Exercises for COPD, Asthma, Bronchitis & Emphysema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpTNUGwXbTU\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.

Some MCU actors like Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd were far from ripped and muscular when they were cast in their respective roles. However, they put in the work to attain the fit and athletic bodies they sport on screen. This is no easy feat, as getting your body into peak shape is an incredibly difficult task. Sometimes it take‚Äôs over a year of strict dieting and workout plans to achieve their goals. And then years more maintaining this shape for future movies in the MCU. Luckily for them, they are provided with top of the line trainers and dieticians that help them along their journey. This definitely helps, but it‚Äôs still on the actors to apply themselves to the regimes assigned. Which actors had difficulties maintaining their diets?\nSometimes the trainers used by these actors are actually good friends with them, as is the case with Chris Hemsworth, who has known his trainer since he was four years old.\n\nAll those muscles aren‚Äôt just for show, and these actors have done some seriously impressive things. One of the Marvel stars can now push a 5,000 pound jeep.

As we get older, our testosterone tends to naturally decline. We can‚Äôt stop it completely, but we can fight back against the loss of our needed male hormones. Having less fat and more muscle is crucial for our testosterone production. When you think of building muscle, you think of resistance training and lifting weights at the gym or at home. While that is the major key for building muscle, there are some needs you need to fo to help optimize muscle growth.\n\nAside from resistance training, there are 2 more major keys for building muscle faster after 50. Recovery and getting good quality sleep is another crucial part for building muscle. That is the time when your body works on repairing the muscle fibers you damage from your workouts, helping them grow bigger during the recovery. \n\nThe last major component is nutrition. In order to build more muscle, you need to make sure that you are consuming enough protein. Protein is the most needed food group in order to build more muscle during your recovery from your workouts. There are a lot of foods you can eat, supplements you can, protein powder you can drink to get protein in your body.

Or in other words, simply figuring out how you‚Äôre going to group your exercises throughout the week. And although there isn‚Äôt one ‚Äúbest workout split‚Äù for everyone, certain muscle building splits have their advantages. For example, we know that training a muscle at least 2x/week is superior to 1x/week. This automatically makes the common bro split inferior to other higher muscle training frequency workout splits. Training splits like the upper lower split, full body workout splits (‚Äútotal body workouts‚Äù), and the push pull legs workout split train each muscle 2x/week whereas the bro split does not. This not only helps better optimize protein synthesis but also enables you to get more quality sets done since your workout volume is spread out over multiple workouts.\n\nBut which of these splits should you choose for mass? Well, it depends on your training experience. The best workout split for beginners looking to put on mass is likely a 3 day workout split with full body workouts. This is because you can train the compound lifts frequently and master them very quickly without causing too much muscle damage. Then, as you gain experience and need more volume to progress, you can switch to a 4 day workout split (such as the upper/lower split) to help spread out your volume better throughout the week. And then, as you progress even more, switching to a 5 day workout split or a 6 day workout split (push pull legs for example) would be wise to keep your workouts from being excessively long and fatiguing. However, despite what research says, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that workout volume and consistency are the more important factors. So choose the workout split that you enjoy the most and best fits your schedule ‚Äì as that‚Äôs going to be the best option for you! \n\nAnd if you‚Äôre looking for a step-by-step program that shows you how to optimize your training and nutrition in order to progress as efficiently as possible, then simply take my starting-point analysis tool below to find which program is best for you: \nhttps://builtwithscience.com/bws-free-fitness-quiz/gender?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=Video&utm_content=Description%20box&utm_campaign=Science%20based%20back%20split%20to%20maximize%20growth%20Jan%206%2F2019\n\nLINK TO WRITTEN ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/best-workout-split/ \n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM & FACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeremyethier/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Jeremyethierfit/\n\nMUSIC:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\nSTUDIES:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729395\n\nOTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES:\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/frequency-muscle/\nhttps://mennohenselmans.com/optimal-program-design/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 427, "publish_time": "20190106"}

Questions about pre-workout backed by science are answered by a real doctor.

They‚Äôre typically a powdered substance that you mix in water and drink before exercise. Ingredients typically will include amino acids BCAAs, B vitamins, caffeine, creatine, nitric oxide precursors, L-arginine, L-citrulline, and artificial sweeteners are often included.

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nThe success of Joker and Venom has completely changed the way movie studios are looking at superhero movies. No longer are our caped heroes standing front and center. With Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad coming soon, we could see a whole slate of super-villain movies hitting the big screen. Why bother trying another stab at remaking the Fantastic Four when there‚Äôs such a better character to focus on instead? Doctor Doom stood in the shadows of both Fantastic Four franchises, serving as the main villain, but not getting fleshed out enough to truly becoming a compelling part of the films. Catwoman had her shot at a solo movie with Halle Berry‚Äôs disappointing cheesefest back in 2004, but there‚Äôs another DC vixen who could really shine with a solo story -- and her name is Poison Ivy. Just the thought of Poison Ivy on the big screen has probably conjured some pretty bad memories of Batman and Robin, but let‚Äôs just pull that withered weed from the garden and start over. Despite the cheesy puns about ice, snow, and everything frozen, you cannot deny the dramatic possibilities of the Mr. Freeze origin story we saw glimpses of in the 1997 disaster Batman & Robin. Arnold Schawnegger‚Äôs portrayal of Mr. Freeze is pretty much a big joke now and has resulted in no other portrayals of the character on the big-screen, but he definitely has a great story to tell. \n\nThe Joker did a deep dive into the character‚Äôs psyche, backstory, and provided a whole new perspective on the madness behind him. But what other villains deserve a similar movie treatment? Between some Marvel juggernauts and DC villains who deserve proper big-screen treatment, let‚Äôs see who should go solo in the future!\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 635, "publish_time": "20191024"}

Initially I was a little apprehensive, worried that my drawing skills might have deteriorated during my time away.\n\nBut as I mention in the video, to my surprise they‚Äôd actually improved! I‚Äôm not sure what the exact reason behind this is, but I suspect that after getting some distance my brain had time to process everything I‚Äôd learned. So when I eventually started drawing again, it was all still there!\n\nI do feel like my work has a bit more rhythm to it now, which feels great. I‚Äôm not thinking about it, or judging it as much anymore. I‚Äôm not too concerned about the small things. The creation process seems to have become quite fluid for me as of recently and I‚Äôm thankful for that.\n\nThe idea for this character design sketch came about after I‚Äôd spent long enough thinking about an idea that had been fermenting inside my mind for the last few months. It was an idea for a comic book, and the more I thought about it, the more complete it became.\n\nEventually I‚Äôd somehow worked out an entire plot in my head without writing anything down at all, and at that point I figured hey, why not put pencil to paper and see if I can‚Äôt come up with a few cool character concepts for this story?\n\nThe character in this video is one of the key players in the plot. He works at a robotics plant where he manufactures bio mechanical replacement bodies for people to transfer their consciousness to when their organic bodies become obsolete. \n\nThe catch is that these body replacements, otherwise known as capsules, are reserved only for the wealthy and the powerful. \nSo of course this character, being a mere engineer at a manufacturing plant would never be able get his hands on one of these bio mechanical bodies, which is unfortunate for him because it just so happens that his younger brother is terminally ill with a rare disease that can‚Äôt be cured. \n\nHowever, he loves his brother and would do anything to save him ‚Äì so he does the unthinkable, illegally uploading his brothers consciousness into a capsule which does not belong to him.\n\nIn fact, this capsule has been set aside and belongs to one of the most powerful and feared gangsters in the entire city. And that‚Äôs just the beginning of the story! But I‚Äôll leave it there for now. I don‚Äôt want to give away too much just yet ‚Äì especially because I have no idea when I‚Äôll get round to actually putting this comic together!\n\nI hope you enjoy the video! \n\nThanks for watching! \n-Clayton\n\nSoftware Used: Manga Studio\n\nIf you like the video, show your support by commenting, sharing or subscribing. \n\nComic Art Community - https://www.howtodrawcomics.net/comic-art-community/\nHow to Draw Comics .NET - http://www.howtodrawcomics.net/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/howtodrawcomics/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/howtodrawcomics\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/howtodrawcomics\nTumblr - http://howtodrawcomics.tumblr.com/\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/howtodrawcomics/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1271, "publish_time": "20190409"}

Strangely satisfying", "description": "Chill out for 10 mins and let us do the work.\n\nI use timelapse filming mainly to prove to myself that at the end of the day I have actually done some work! Most of these shots cover several hours of digging condensed into just a matter of seconds- but when you're in the woods digging, especially if you're alone, progress can seem painfully slow sometimes! Making a big landing takes so much effort, the volume of dirt alone can mean hundreds, maybe thousands of wheelbarrows to fill, move and empty. \n\nI find that filming a timelapse stops me from getting lazy - if I stop digging to call or message someone it looks very obvious in the shot. You have to keep busy and keep moving. It's a good way of making sure you don't stop until the job is done. I generally set myself a target of something to achieve and then don't go home until it's done- even if it means getting lights out of my car and digging into the night. \n\nThis video is a mash-up of some of the timelapses I have shot over the last few years either of me alone (cheeky week day visits) or with the crew all digging together on Sunday. Even tho we're hopefully nearing the point when we can all return to our local trail spots- it's been weeks since I have ridden or done any digging. I plan to ease myself back into things and spend more time on a shovel than a bike for a while. \n\nReally hope you enjoy the video... Next week's video is a little different from the norm so look out for that one!\n\nTake it easy - oh yeah and subscribe ;-)", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 545, "publish_time": "20200515"}

We are going to talk about composition in painting and learn a few techniques.\n\nColors used: Yellow Ochre, Olive Green, Quinacridone Sienna, Burnt Sienna, Cobalt Blue, Ultramarine Blue, Alizarin Crimson.\n\nPaint: I use a variety of watercolor paint brands (Daniel Smith, Holbein, M.Graham, Nevskaya Palitra). \n\nPaper: Arches, rough texture. You may use any brand you like but, most importantly for this technique, use 100% cotton. \n\nBrushes: I use a variety of brushes by different brands: Silver Brush, Chinese calligraphy brushes from Blue Heron Art and Michael Solovyev, squirrel brushes by Roubleff, synthetic by Escoda and Etchr, Aliexpress, and a few other different brands. I think it is helpful to buy good quality brushes but most important is the time you spend with that brush. \n\nMusic from YouTube's free music library.\n\nMy Etsy shop: https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/AlinaTulliArt\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/alinatulli/ \n\n#watercolortutorial #waterfallpainting #watercolorwaterfall #landscapetutorial #watercolorintermediate #aquarela #aquarelle #paintingtutorial #relaxingwatercolor #relaxingart", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 884, "publish_time": "20220428"}

After completing a two-year journey in our Airstream to see all 50 states and 51 National Parks, we left to travel abroad. We have downsized our possessions and sold our home so that we can wander about with only the things in our backpacks. \n\nWe love living on the road, traveling each week to a new location. We plan to travel extensively to every part of the world. Ours is not a slow travel lifestyle but rather a vagabondish one. The goal is not to check a country off a list, but to experience it by meeting new people, seeing how others live, and making new friends. We believe in laughing, loving, and living our lives to the fullest. \n\nWe are working hard to build a beautiful website where you can get travel information about the places we have been. In addition, we post blog articles to help you travel better. Our channel is a way of augmenting that effort, so sometimes we post videos about how to travel or a vlog showing our lives on the road as we do an activity or an adventure.

This is just the spot to cool off after a day on the beach. Laze around the pool, or move to the shaded deck upstairs and enjoy burgers fresh off the grill seated at the covered dining area. You can even watch your favorite sports channel on the outdoor TV.\n\nBe sure to turn the lights on around the pool at night and see how beautiful it is .\n\nThere are child protective gates on both levels of the house, so young children will not be able to access the pool area without an adult opening the gate.\n\nJumping and diving are not permitted and there should always be adult supervision when there are children in the pool.\n\nWhen the kids get tired of swimming in the pool they can move to the garage and play ping pong and fuss ball. You can open the garage door and then lower a screened door to allow for ventilation. And just in case the kids work up a thirst there is a small refrigerator there also. This is handy for the pool area too, so you don't have to go back to the house for cold drinks.\n\nThe outdoor shower with hot and cold water is just outside the garage - perfect for getting all the sand off before hitting the pool!\n\nThe kitchen is super well stocked and has everything you will need to prepare meals for your group. It has a breakfast bar with additional seating just in case there is not enough room for everyone round the dining table.\n\nThe 3 bedrooms consist of a king in the master bedroom with TV, large walk in closet and en suite bathroom.\n\nThe second bedroom has a queen bed and TV and the third bedroom is ideal for kids with a bunk bed with a single on top and a double below - and then there is even another bed that pulls out. The kids will love it! And they also have their own TV!\n\nThe den downstairs is comfy and cozy with an electric fireplace, 65 inch TV, games for the kids and there is also a queen sleeper sofa for those extra guests.\n\nThe third bathroom and laundry is also on this level and is convenient to the pool - no need to go all the way upstairs.\n\nOf course the house has ceiling fans in all rooms, wifi, pool toys and chairs for the beach with a buggy to transport them over. It literally takes about 3 minutes to walk from the house to the closest beach access - it is really no distance at all.\n\nThe house is dog friendly for most breeds with a 40 pound limit on size. You will have to show proof of vet prescribed flea medication and provide covers to protect furniture and bedding from pet hair.\n\nThree grocery stores are near by and the historic downtown is about 10 minutes by car, so the situation is ideal and this house really offers everything possible to make this your best vacation ever!", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 303, "publish_time": "20190627"}

Because while a lot of us are familiar with some of the more obvious effects in terms of our cardiovascular health and general fitness, there are some incredible, lesser-known benefits that make aerobic exercise an essential component of our overall health and wellness.\n\nAnd to give you some additional support in terms of incorporating more aerobic exercise into your routine this week, I‚Äôm also going to give you some quick and simple tips on routines and activities you can do to get started. Particularly ones that are very time efficient and effective.\n\nThe Top Health Benefits of Aerobic Exercise (0:44)\n\n#1 Helps Build a Stronger Immune System\n\nMost guys don‚Äôt know that consistent aerobic exercise is research-proven to keep your immune system strong and help your body ward off common illnesses like the flu or a cold.\n\n#2 Great Way to Burn Fat\n\nAerobics also increase your fat-burning capacity ‚Äì long after you‚Äôre done exercising: By regularly doing aerobic exercise, your muscles develop a higher number of mitochondria, which help you burn more fat at rest ‚Äì even when you‚Äôre not exercising.\n\n#3 Correlated with a Longer Lifespan\n\nAerobics help you live longer: According to the newest scientific research, those who engage in aerobic exercise live longer than those who do not.\n\n#4 Helps Improve Your Brain Function\n\nAerobics makes you smarter: New research also shows that aerobics increases your brain‚Äôs production of a molecule called Irisin that improves memory and protects our brains against degeneration.\n\n#5 Improves Cardiovascular Health\n\nAerobics makes your heart stronger: Aerobics train your heart to beat more efficiently, so your heart doesn‚Äôt have to work as hard. \n\nThat‚Äôs why aerobically fit people have lower heart rates than non-fit people. In fact, elite athletes often have resting heart rates as low as 40 beats per minute (the average man over 40 is 90bpm).\n\n#6 Decreases Chance of Disease\n\nAerobics ward off most major health risks: Studies also show that aerobics helps reduce your risk of diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure.\n\nHow to Get Started With Aerobic Exercise (4:20)\n\nNow, after understanding these top benefits of aerobic exercise, it‚Äôs also important to look at the best practice for aerobic exercise. Because for those of us with busy schedules, it can be pretty difficult to fit in an hour or two each day of light jogging or running on the treadmill to get these benefits. But thankfully, as you‚Äôll discover in this video, there is a much more time-efficient way to get started with aerobic exercise and still see the amazing effects.\n\n#1 Daily Walking\n#2 Regular Cardio\n#3 Strength & Cardio Circuit Training\n\nSo I hope this guide leaves you with some added motivation to incorporate more aerobic exercise into your routine, and some simple ideas on how to get started. Because once you do, I think you‚Äôll find that aerobic exercise is an essential part of creating the healthy lifestyle you‚Äôre working towards, and it doesn‚Äôt have to eat up a ton of time to make it happen.\n\nIf you feel your lifestyle could use an improvement, then check out our FF30X 30-Day Transformation Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-ff30x-program\nIf you want to start putting on muscle TODAY, check out our Fit Father Old School Muscle Building Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-osm-program\n\nYour friends here at the FFP, \n\n-Dr. Balduzzi + The Men's Health Experts @ The Fit Father Project\n\n**Disclaimer: This information is for reference purposes ONLY and cannot replace personal information you can and should discuss with your Doctor.

With her twins in college, this empty-nester is left trying to mend her fractured friendships. \n\nAlways on the move, Heather Dubrow and husband Terry find themselves routinely commuting between Orange County and their new estate in Beverly Hills. After many years of friendship, Heather and Gina find themselves at odds over loyalty and betrayal. \n\nNo longer a Tres Amiga, Tamra Judge is putting her energy into developing stronger friendships and helping her daughter Sophia, who recently turned 18, navigate her gap year. Tamra‚Äôs damaged friendship with Shannon is hotly contested as she wonders if Shannon is truly remorseful for her accident. \n\nGina Kirschenheiter has leveled up as a realtor, but her professional reputation is called into question after one of the ladies puts her in a sticky situation. Her relationship with Travis takes an unconventional turn when deciding she wants to live separately, but stay together. On top of this, as Gina watches bestie Emily get close to Tamra, she wonders if their friendship will remain the same. \n\nEmily Simpson has gone through an incredible transformation after losing 40 pounds and finds herself trying to adjust to her new healthy lifestyle. When she‚Äôs not helping the wrongly convicted as a part of the California Innocence Project, she‚Äôs questioning the ladies on everything from integrity to intentions. \n\nJennifer Pedranti is ready for a fresh start with Tamra while also trying to prove that her boyfriend, Ryan, is worthy of redemption. While some of the ladies in the group wonder if she has truly learned from her past mistakes, Jennifer finds some commonality with new housewife Katie. New to Orange County, Katie Ginella and her husband, professional golf journalist Matt Ginella, recently moved from San Diego. \n\nNow ready to learn more about her Korean heritage and connect to her roots, Katie decides to explore her adoption further and meet her birth mother. A longtime friend of Heather and Emily, Alexis Bellino comes in full force ready to make waves. She finds her footing with most of the ladies and starts fresh with Tamra, but she instantly finds herself on shaky ground with Shannon as they face off in a series of high-stakes disputes. \n\nCast:\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nTamra Judge\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nKatie Ginella\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Most people think that one only needs to get the right color at the right place but there is an almost infinite number of ways to apply the same color at the same spot and this is where the difference between beginners and masters lies.\nTypically, a beginner will use a very limited selection of paint application techniques: the movement of the brush will most likely come from the fingers and the brush is usually held like a pencil, near the ferrule, which limits the amplitude of the stroke. Very often, the angle of the brush related to the canvas is close to 90¬∞and the pressure is usually stronger than needed, similar to writing. \nObviously, we all went through this and it‚Äôs perfectly normal to have a more limited range of techniques at first. For a beginner, you see, painting is so new that it feels reassuring to start with a paint handling technique that feels familiar, that‚Äôs why the most common thing is to to hold the brush like a pencil. Everybody knows how to write and draw with a pencil so, when you take a paintbrush in your hand, it feels natural to hold it like a pencil.\nAnd let‚Äôs say it right away, it‚Äôs fine ! This way of holding the brush is perfectly adapted for details and finitions, the only problem is‚Ä¶ not everything can be about details and precision. Imagine that you visit a museum and can only look at the paintings through a magnifying glass, that would be a very poor experience because you‚Äôd miss the whole context.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 The problem most beginners have\n01:45  78,732 ways to apply the same color\rat the same spot\n06:44 Break\n07:11 Control the amount of paint in your brush\n07:45 Visualize your brush stroke \n08:53 Not happy?

We cannot be of\nany profit to Him, nor love Him with this first love. Yet God demands of us, that as He has loved us without any second thoughts, so He should be loved by us. In what way can we do this, then, since He demands it of us and we cannot give it to Him? I tell you: through a means which He has established by which we can love Him freely, and without the least regard to any profit of ours: we can be useful, not to Him, which is impossible, but to our neighbour...To show the love we have to Him, we ought to serve and love every rational creature...Every virtue receives life from love, and love is gained in love, that is, by raising the eye of our mind to behold how much we are beloved of God. Seeing ourselves loved, we cannot do otherwise than love...So thou seest that we conceive virtues through God and bring them to the birth for our neighbour.\n-- Saint Catherine of Sienna", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 788, "publish_time": "20240619"}

{"cate": ["Howto & Style"], "query": null, "uploader": "Chris Breier", "uploader_id": "@ChrisBreier", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmaYj7TEwB4", "video_id": "wmaYj7TEwB4", "title": "How to Blend Acrylics Like Oils", "description": "Amazon CHAPTERS\nClick on the time stamp to jump to a specific chapter\n0:00 Introduction\n0:15 Using OPEN acrylics or regular acrylics with retarder\n2:00 How to create smooth blends with acrylics\n5:02 Creating soft edges with acrylics\n8:32 How to keep acrylic paint wet on the palette\n9:53 Finishing touches\n10:22 the finished still life painting\n\nIn this video, I demonstrate how to blend acrylics in a manner that's similar to oils. The secret to blending acrylics is to use acrylic retarder to prevent the paint from drying out too soon. I prefer to use Golden OPEN acrylics because the retarder is already mixed into the paint.\n\nI usually blend acrylics after I apply the colors to the canvas. Another tip is to blend the paint with a soft brush. \n\nI also demonstrate how to create soft edges with acrylics. Soft edges have a blurry, out of focus appearance to them. The soft edges make the hard edges stand out more. This is a way to guide the viewers eye to the focal point.\n\nJudging the colors while placing them on a white canvas can be tricky. I find that I have to adjust the values as the painting progresses.\n\nART SUPPLIES & TOOLS USED IN THIS VIDEO\nAll of the links that lead to Blick Art Materials or Amazon are affiliate links. This means that if you click on a link and make a purchase, I earn a commission at no cost to you.\n\nGOLDEN OPEN ACRYLICS\nI used Golden OPEN acrylics for this painting. They're convenient because the retarder is already in the paint, in the proper proportions. The link below contains sets of small tubes of OPEN acrylics so you can try them out, or you can buy the standard sized tubes of individual colors.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5m9\n\nTHE COLORS I USED IN THIS PAINTING\nTitanium White \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcp\nAmazon https://amzn.to/334LyRp\n\nQuinacridone Magenta \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcq\nAmazon https://amzn.to/34rtEt7\n\nUltramarine Blue \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcs\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3f7k9RX\n\nHansa Yellow Opaque \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcu\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3sYSB9w\n\nCarbon Black \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcx\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3qRnNoe\n\nACRYLIC RETARDERS\nYou can add retarder to any brand of acrylics to make them dry slower. This is useful if you already have a brand of acrylics that you prefer. Follow the instructions, you usually don't want to add any more than 25%-30% retarder because it may take too long to dry. The paint may remain tacky even after it dries if you add too much. \n\nGolden Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5mc\nLiquitex Slo-Dri Medium http://shrsl.com/2j5me\nWinsor & Newton Galeria Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5mi\nGrumbacher Artists Acrylic Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5ml\n\nBRUSHES\nI use mostly synthetic brushes that are made for acrylics like these ones from Robert Simmons\nhttp://shrsl.com/3a082\nThe softer brushes are for watercolor.\n\nACRYLIC PALETTES\nThe Masterson Stay Wet Palette is a large plastic box with a tight fitting lid. It comes with a sponge and palette paper. I find that I don't need the sponge to keep the OPEN acrylics wet, but you may need to use it if you live in a very hot and dry climate. It works better than a Tupperware container because the sides of the wall are lower, and it's large. Here is the 12\"x16\" Masterson Palette I use in the video http://shrsl.com/2j5n4\n\nThis is the smaller palette that I store inside of the Masterson Palette.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5nc\n\nSince the OPEN acrylics stay wet for so long, I never really have to peel the paint off. I just clean it with a wet paper towel or rag. I find the microfiber towels work great.\n\nMICROFIBER TOWELS\nI bought a large package of these on Amazon, the link is below. The small fibers create more surface area than paper towels and they do seem to make it easier to clean things. They work great for drying paint brushes and cleaning palettes. Make sure that you handle them properly if you use them with oil paints because they can spontaneously combust.\nhttps://amzn.to/2GdvMsn\n\nTABLE TOP EASEL\nThis is where you can buy the easel I use in the video:\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5ni\n\nI have been using this table top easel for some time now and I like how portable it is. The top folds down and it has a handle which makes it easy to carry. The drawer on the bottom opens to the side and the inside is divided into separate compartments for storing pencils, brushes, and tubes of paint.\n\nPAINT SPATULA\nThis paint spatula from Princeton is handy tool to have in the studio.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5no\n\nCANVAS PANELS\nI've tried out a number or brands of canvas panels, but I'm really fond of the ones made by Raymar. They're acrylic primed and they're backed with a gray melamine that makes them even more resistant to warping. You can buy them on Blick http://shrsl.com/2j5nr\n\nUSING PENCIL TO SKETCH ON CANVAS\nPencils with harder leads are less likely to smear as you paint over them. I discuss this in-depth on my blog.\nhttps://drawandpaintforfun.com/best-pencil-on-canvas/\n\nMUSIC: \"A Night Alone\" by TrackTribe", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 641, "publish_time": "20200930"}

You know the feeling when you‚Äôre half way through a painting and it isn‚Äôt working out? Maybe it‚Äôs not the values, drawing or the colour - very likely it‚Äôs just that the set up was put together too quickly without a lot of thought.\n\nSo it's really worth takng some time to learn how to set up a still life. Good still life paintings (and most paintings, really) rely on the pattern of lights and darks, and you can create that before you even squeeze out any paint by carefully putting together the still life composition on your stand.

It produced reasonable power from 1250rpm and crested at around 4500rpm, providing a near perfect torque band before reaching the speed cutoff at 7000rpm. \n\nBecause BMW intended the engine to function reliably and retain the feel of a much larger v8, throttle lag was practically non-existent (for a turbo engine). \n\nThe N55 prefers higher octane gasoline because it provides more power and better efficiency, with most users saying that the expense per mile is the same as when using low octane fuel. \n\nThe N54 and N55 engines were identical in many ways, but the most notable change was that the later N55 model had a contemporary single twinscroll turbine, as opposed to the N54's twin-turbocharger.\n\nA single turbo is less expensive, lighter, and has a few advantages, but the twin-turbo configuration provides more possible power increases from upgrades. However, the benefits of a bigger single twin scroll turbo are still substantial and sufficient for most tuning tasks. Surprisingly, Alpina chose a twin turbo system in their performance versions. Generally, the N55 improved on the N54 and was in production from 2009 to 2015, when it was superseded by the B57 engine. \n\nWith the introduction of the Alpina tuned models we saw the N55 factory power varies from a respectable 302 bhp to 425 bhp and with mapping adjustments it is possible to add around 80hp on the basic engine.\n\nAir Induction kits and Exhaust will NOT usually ADD TORQUE for most stock N55 configurations on their own, but they will allow you to increase power after other improvements by removing the limitation you hit with other mods as the factory setup runs out of capacity to cope. \n\nFlowing and porting the Head - Flowing and porting the head will get air streaming into the engine while eliminating turbulence or limitations. \n\nTurbo upgrades - forced induction is the most important method to increase the air flow to your intake, enabling you to consume more gasoline and gain power. \n\nN55 remapping offers the most power for the money, but new ECUs and integrated Tuning boxes are also options.\n\nChapters\n0:00 Intro\n2:34 Spark Plug Selection\n3:00 Intercoolers\n4:07 Turbo Upgrades\n6:00 Fuel - Port Injection Fuel Types\n6:17 Engine Tuning (Remapping)\n8:08 Induction Kits & Intakes\n9:05 Head Work Gas Flowing Valves\n10:15 Stronger Engine Parts\n11:11 Injector Upgrades\n12:02 Exhaust Mods \n14:20 Forged Crank Pistons\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IG-bqFLaujU?t=181 Intercoolers\n\nThe following cars came with the N55 engine: 2009‚Äì2017 F10/F11/F07 535i, 2010‚Äì2013 E90/E91/E92/E93 335i, 2010‚Äì2013 E82/E88 135i, 2010‚Äì2017 F25 X3 xDrive35i, 2011‚Äì2013 E70 X5 xDrive35i, 2011‚Äì2015 F30/F31 335i, 2011‚Äì2014 E71 X6 xDrive35i, 2012‚Äì2015 E84 X1 xDrive35i, 2013‚Äì2016 F32/F33/F36 435i, 2014‚Äì2018 F15 X5 xDrive35i, 2014‚Äì2019 F16 X6 xDrive35i, and 2014‚Äì2016 F26 X4 xDrive35i.

It was the custom shop behind the first really mainstream car show, Pimp My Ride, and since Pimp My  Ride ended the shop has gone on to be behind another car show named Inside West Coast Customs. \n\nThe shop has a very interesting history too and is probably the one shop in the world that does not have an exact founding date. According to some, the shop was founded way back in 1994, and others say it was 1997.\n\nIn any case, what we do know for sure is that the shop was incorporated in the year 2000 by Ryan Friedlinghaus, a young mechanic who had a passion for building custom made cars. \n\nHowever, Friedlinghaus had discovered quite early in his life that there were almost no garages that could do all everything needed to make a custom car in-house. \n\nSo he created West Coast Customs as a shop that could make custom cars from top to bottom without outsourcing any part of the vehicle. That was his vision for West Coast Customs, and for a while, that was precisely what the shop was. \n\nAt first, the shop did not get a lot of orders, but soon celebrities like Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal started bringing their expensive cars around for custom effects and that is when West Coast Customs blew up.\n\nBefore long, the shop drew the attention of media giants MTV and they pitched the show Pimp My Ride to Friedlinghaus. But here was the catch, Friedlinghaus was not going to be the host of the show. It would merely be hosted in his shop and he would be the one to coordinate the actual work on the vehicles. The real host of the show would be a rapper named Xzibit. \n\nIn the end, Pimp My Ride was a successful show, but after the first few years, West Coast Customs started seeing the first problems that would eventually run the shop out of reality TV shows forever. \n\n#InsideWestCoastCustoms", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 507, "publish_time": "20220627"}

First off, there's not a single Porsche part on the car.\n\nPorsche Engineering Services helped with reengineering the W124's engine compartment to fit in the 32-valve, 4-cam M119 V-8 ‚Äî for both the 400E and the 500E.\n\nBut the 500E doesn't use the same V-8 as the 500SL. It needed shorter connecting rods so that it fit in the same physical space as the 4.2-liter 400E ‚Äî this way only one structural variant needed to be produced.\n\nThe 400E was a response to the Lexus LS400. Why do you think it wasn't called a 420E?\n\nPorsche also did the engineering to bolt up wheels, tires, brakes, and suspension components from the wider and heavier R129 500SL and W124 500SEL. That necessitated fender flares so wide that the 500E didn't fit down the regular W124 production line in Sindelfingen. \n\nFor both models, Porsche performed the physical modifications to Mercedes-built W124 chassis, and sent them back to Sindelfingen for paint. The 400E remained there, but because of its width, the 500E was sent back to Porsche, which assembled the 500E at a second Zuffenhausen factory.\n\nWith Bruno Sacco's revolutionary looks, aerodynamics, obsession with safety, and Mercedes build quality and engineering might, the W124 was certainly among the best (and most expensive) sedans in the world.\n\nStill is. It's close to perfect. But it's not a Porsche Sports Sedan.\n\n=\n\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

Kitco regrets the error.]\n\nMargins are still a struggle for the miners despite energy costs coming down, said Rick Rule, president and CEO of Rule Investment Media.\n\nRule Spoke to Kitco Mining on Wednesday at the 2024 Precious Metals Summit Beaver Creek in Colorado. Rule is also the former CEO and president of Sprott U.S. Holdings.\n\nRule said it is a good market to invest in. He sees opportunities due to the disparity between rising commodity prices and stagnant equity prices. He focuses on companies with proven management teams and large-scale projects. Rule is open to investing in jurisdictions with perceived political risk.\n\nBut a lot of juniors are too small to make it, said Rule. \n\n‚ÄúMost of the juniors are subscale. They are so small that general administrative expenses consume most of the capital they raise,‚Äù said Rule. \n\n‚ÄúThose companies are doomed to fail. I suspect that three quarters of the juniors that are public worldwide ‚Äî Australia, Canada, the United States, Great Britain ‚Äî are valueless, absolutely valueless.‚Äù \n\nRule said the cost of oil has dropped, which helps, but other costs keep climbing. \n\n‚ÄúEnergy costs have moderated, which is a good thing,‚Äù said Rule. ‚ÄúBut the social take, which is to say taxes, royalties‚Ä¶ things like that are increasing ‚Äî at about 15 percent compounded. Labor costs are going up, spare parts are going up, finished steel is going up. \n\n‚ÄúI think there will be continued disappointment among investors about the fact that the margins, the producing margins, aren't increasing as fast as one would hope, given the increase in gold price.‚Äù\n\nRule said investors have to keep scale in mind. Bigger is better. \n\n‚ÄúEverything that can go wrong with a big mine can go wrong with a small mine,‚Äù said Rule. ‚ÄúBut a small mine can never make you big money.‚Äù\n\nStanding out is key, Rule said.

If you‚Äôre looking for a simple yet very effective way of losing weight and improving your overall health, walking is something just for you. \nPeople who are physically active throughout their life are much less prone to this disease than those who have a more sedentary lifestyle. And that‚Äôs because they have more volume in their hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning.   \nA daily half-hour walk helps avoid serious problems, like coronary heart disease to name one, by lowering high blood pressure and cholesterol levels and improving blood circulation. Because of better-quality and deeper breathing, some symptoms associated with lung disease can show significant improvement thanks to walking. \nMuscle tone and weight loss is also totally achievable through simple walking. Find your optimal pace, but don‚Äôt break out into a jog. This sort of speed walking is low impact and doesn‚Äôt require any recovery time, which means no sore muscles to keep you from getting out and walking the next day.\nThe Arthritis Foundation recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate walking a day to reduce pain, stiffness, and inflammation in the joints. Building strong bones will help you prevent osteoporosis and reduce bone loss. Walking contributes to better blood circulation within the spinal structures, pumping important nutrients into the soft tissues and improving posture and flexibility, both of which are vital for a healthy spine.\nA group of researchers at Iowa State University worked with hundreds of college students. Walking changed their mood for the better, even though no one warned them it could do so.\nIf you still don‚Äôt feel motivated enough to start walking for your health, try joining a class or find a buddy who also wouldn‚Äôt mind getting all the benefits of walking. Another idea could be to hire a personal trainer.\n\nMusic: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music\n\nTIMESTAMPS\nBrain-boosting effect 0:45\nImproved eyesight 1:44\nPrevention of heart disease 2:47\nIncreased lung volume 3:14\nBenefits for the pancreas 3:51\nImproved digestion 4:23\nToned muscles 4:59\nSturdier bones and joints 5:45\nBack pain relief 6:10\nA calmer mind 7:04\nBonus: the FIT formula 8:00\n\nSUMMARY\n-Walking prevents the early onset of dementia, reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and improves your overall mental well-being by reducing stress and releasing endorphins.\n-Get on the road to improve vision and protect your eyes now from potential problems, such as glaucoma, in the future. \n-Walking is no less effective than running when it comes to the prevention of heart disease and stroke.\n-Walking is an aerobic exercise, which means that it increases oxygen flow in the bloodstream and helps eliminate toxins and waste, which is great for your lungs. \n-Walking for exercise is a surprisingly more effective way to prevent diabetes than running is.\n-Just half an hour of walking every day not only lowers the risk of developing colon cancer but also improves digestion and regulates bowel movements.\n-Just 10,000 steps a day can be just as effective as a full-blown workout at the gym, especially if you add some intervals or uphill walking.\n-Walking can provide more joint mobility, prevent the loss of bone density, and even reduce the risk of fractures.\n-Walking is a real life-saver for those who experience back pain during more challenging high-impact exercises.\n-Walking improves depression symptoms in patients with MDD, just imagine how easily it could help us cope with just feeling down or exhausted.\n-Keep in mind the FIT formula. It stands for Frequency (how often), Intensity (how fast), and Time (for how long).\n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\n\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.brightside.me/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 608, "publish_time": "20180416"}

Furthermore, nearly 80% of those individuals who suffer a sprain are likely to experience re-injury.\n\nA number of studies have demonstrated the positive effects of exercise for treating ankle sprains, but researchers have questioned how the addition of manual therapy might influence outcomes.\n\nIn 2013, Cleland and colleagues demonstrated that those put in a manual therapy (joint mobilizations) plus exercise group did better in terms of pain and function than those in an exercise-only group at 4 weeks and 6 months.\n\nThere is a lot of hate out there right now for manual therapy, and while I realize exercise has the best evidence, ankle sprains may be one issue where seeing a physio for a combination of skilled manual care and exercise guidance would be wise.\n\nReferences: \n\n1.

After reviewing the research out there, it seems that using heavy or light weights actually doesn‚Äôt matter much in terms of hypertrophy. Studies show that muscle growth tends to be equal despite using light weights or heavy weights (high rep vs low rep). But this is only true when going to near failure, and one benefit of lifting heavy weights is the better strength gains you see when compared to light weights. Based on this, as you‚Äôll see in my video, your best bet is to incorporate high reps with light weights AND low reps with heavy weights into your workout. This will enable you to target both metabolic stress and mechanical tension; both are important mechanisms of muscle growth. \n\nLIGHT WEIGHTS VS HEAVY WEIGHTS ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/light-weights-heavy-weights/ \n\n You can browse around my website and read the articles I do have up (I‚Äôll be adding more articles on a regular basis).

Dr. Mandell", "description": "Engaging in calf pumps while seated offers an array of health benefits that extend far beyond simple leg exercise. Firstly, this activity significantly enhances circulation by utilizing the \"muscle pump\" mechanism. When the calf muscles contract, they compress the veins running through them, effectively pushing blood upward towards the heart. The one-way valves in these veins prevent the blood from flowing back down, ensuring efficient venous return and reducing the risk of blood pooling, swelling, and conditions like varicose veins. Improved circulation means that oxygen and nutrients are more effectively delivered throughout the body, supporting overall cellular function and health.\n\nAdditionally, calf pumps play a crucial role in blood sugar regulation. The muscle contractions increase glucose uptake from the bloodstream into the muscle cells, where it is used for energy, thereby helping to lower blood sugar levels. This process also improves insulin sensitivity, meaning the body requires less insulin to manage blood glucose levels effectively. Enhanced insulin sensitivity is particularly beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, as it helps to maintain more stable blood sugar levels and reduces the risk of postprandial glucose spikes.\n\nMoreover, calf pumps can significantly aid in digestion. The improved circulation ensures that digestive organs receive a better supply of oxygen and nutrients, which enhances their functionality. The physical activity also stimulates the autonomic nervous system, promoting peristalsis‚Äîthe wave-like contractions that move food through the digestive tract. This helps to prevent common digestive issues such as bloating and constipation, leading to more efficient digestion and nutrient absorption.\n\nIncorporating regular calf pumps while seated can also help reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition that can occur during prolonged periods of inactivity, such as long flights or desk jobs. By promoting blood flow and reducing stasis in the veins, calf pumps serve as a preventative measure against this potentially serious condition. Additionally, improved lymphatic circulation facilitated by these exercises aids in the removal of metabolic waste products, contributing to overall better health and reduced inflammation.\n\nIn summary, the simple act of performing calf pumps while seated offers numerous health benefits, including enhanced circulation, improved blood sugar regulation and insulin sensitivity, better digestion, and protection against conditions like DVT. This easy-to-implement activity is a powerful tool for maintaining and improving overall health, especially for individuals who spend extended periods sitting.\n\n****************************************************\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

This video provides information about the cerebellum connection.  All balancing exercises in this video are inspired by the book ADHD 2.0 by Edward Hallowell and John Ratey.  The balancing exercises in this video target the cerebellum and the vestibular system of the inner ear. These two areas combined are referred to as the vestibulo cerebellar system.  Compelling evidence from research citings in this book suggest that strengthening this system not only improves physical skill but also attention and focus and emotional regulation. Chapter three of this book goes into detail regarding the cerebellum connection. What interested me the most about this connection is the affect of calming emotions.  I've personally tried balancing exercises with children who struggle with emotional dysregulation and I've seen first had how the balancing is used as a \"bottom up\" regulation tool that younger children can access to help bring balance to an emotionally hijacked brain. Since their frontal lobes are so underdeveloped (the frontal lobes are used for \"top down\" regulation techniques), this is an exciting intervention for them to experience.  The book introduces the concept of stimulating the cerebellum through balance to regulate emotions and increase focus and attention. Since reading ADHD 2.0 I have introduced all the children and teens I work with to balancing exercises and I made this video for them to practice over the summer and outside of school hours.  This is just an introduction to some of the most popular balancing activities.  I've also incorporated some Bal-a-Vis-X with the two small rubber balls and the cross body movements.  \n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nThe balance board can be found on Amazon.\n\nBook: ADHD 2.0  (found on Amazon and other book sellers).\n\nThe book mentions a program called Zing Performance.

This all happens in the blink of an eye. Even at a younger age you will see people who play sports can do this much faster and land much more safely than people who do not play sport. This is a skill that can be trained and needs constant exposure to maintain it's fast response. A very slow response is what you see with an older person who has not spent time developing skills of balance, agility and power. The chance of a injury from a fall is very likely. \n\n\nMost of the current core workouts is all about training abdominal muscles in isolation using crunches, planks, and various other floor based exercises. The belief here is that if you train your core like you would with a bicep curl to make a bicep stronger, you will have improved balance and function. Unfortunately it does not work this way at all. For starters there is no need for fast reflex reactions as you are already on the floor. Secondly, planks and other traditional abdominal exercises are of little use to the older adult and more likely to cause more harm than good for these exercises are all about stiffness and rigidity. The older adult already has too much stiffness and rigidity, they do not need more.\n\nThe key is in using exercises that demand a reflex response that can teach them more effective ways to restore balance and stability.\n\nWe know the amazing benefits of agility training with sports for improving reaction times and reflex skills. The same is true for older adults but instead of improved sporting performance we may be able to save their life!\n\nStatistics in the US show that one adult over the age of 65 is treated in the emergency room for a fall every 18 seconds (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Quite an alarming statistic and even more scary when you consider that hip fractures are the most common injury from a fall and the number one cause of nursing home admission. Approximately 50% of those who suffer a hip fracture never fully regain their mobility and independence, and 50% of those die within the first year! Falling for an older adult is a very serious matter, and a life threatening situation. \n\nOther great articles to read about this subject are below\n\nStability Training What Is It Really & How To Do It\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/246-stability-training-what-is-it-really-why-is-it-so-important\n\nStrength Training For Older Adults\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/179-can-you-slow-the-ageing-process-with-exercise\n\nReduce Arthritis & Improve Bone Density\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/214-how-to-reduce-arthritis-symptoms-improve-overall-bone-density\n\nAnd if you live in Melbourne and would like to know more about our specific Older Adults Strength Training program go to our website in the link below\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/187-stronger-for-longer-older-adults-training", "quality": "1440x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20190221"}

You see, the core is generally made up of four key components. Namely - the rectus abdominus (6pack / lower abs), obliques, the serratus anterior, and the transverse abdominus (inner abs).\n\nüëâCoaching Programs: https://www.fraserwilsonfitness.com\n\nThe obliques are an absolute must when it comes to developing an aesthetic physique. If your goal is to attain the V tapered look, there‚Äôs no way around training them.

Overall, you can‚Äôt skimp on your obliques for aesthetic and performance, and the best way to ensure that you stay on track is to keep your workouts fresh & challenging\n\nThe serratus is a muscle that originates on your upper rib cage and attaches to the media border of the shoulder blade (basically the shark gill looking things). The serratus muscles play a pivotal role in framing out your abs, obliques and lower pec.

You've come to the right place!\n\n\n---\n\n\nWhy do you get so sore after leg day?\n\n\nWe know that our muscles get sore when we work them hard, whether that‚Äôs through lifting heavy weights, doing tons of reps, or burning them out through long or intense cardio.\n\n\nBut why do legs get more sore than your other muscles? \n\n\nThe simple answer is that there are many muscles in your legs, and they‚Äôre quite large‚Ä¶ which means it‚Äôs a lot harder for them to recover.\n\n\nThere are two different kinds of muscle soreness you should be aware of.\n\n\nThe first kind of muscle soreness is acute, or immediate soreness. As you challenge your muscles, they build up lactic acid, which is what causes the familiar ‚Äúburning sensation‚Äù you get right before your muscles fail.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs this quick onset soreness that you feel in the gym, between sets, or right after you finish your workout.\n\n\nIt typically won‚Äôt last more than a few minutes, or at worst, a few hours after you finish working out.\n\n\nThe second kind of muscle soreness, and the kind that can make leg day miserable, is delayed soreness, often called DOMS or Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.\n\n\nDOMS is exactly what it sounds like, and it explains why your legs are so sore the next day or two after a tough leg workout.\n\n\nOn a physiological level, the process of lifting weights and building muscle involves causing lots of microscopic tears in your muscle fibers. When these tears are repaired through rest, nutrition, and recovery, you build new muscle and gain strength.\n\n\nBut in the meantime, it can hurt‚Ä¶ a lot! The micro-tears in your muscles will swell, become inflamed, and cause you some pain while they‚Äôre recovering.\n\n\nMost experts believe DOMS are worse in your legs because of the large size of the muscle groups, and the fact that you‚Äôll lift heavier loads than you would during, say, a bicep curl.\n\n\nSo now that you understand a little bit of the science behind leg soreness, you know that it‚Äôs totally normal, and is often a sign of a great workout!\n\n\nBut what can you do to ease that soreness? Here are 5 tips that might help.\n----\n1. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate\n\n\nThis is a good idea on almost any day, but it counts double for recovering from leg day.\n\n\nMake sure you hydrate plenty before, during, and after your workout, as well as in the days following it while you recover.\n\n\nProper hydration helps your muscles heal and delivers nutrients to the parts of your body that need it the most.\n\n\nThere‚Äôs no hard and fast rule for this, but you‚Äôll sometimes see health experts recommend the 8 by 8 approach ‚Äî that‚Äôs eight 8 ounce glasses of water every day.\n---\n\n\n2. Stretch out those quads and hammies!\n\n\nMost people know the importance of properly warming up, but just as important (and probably even more likely to be skipped) is a good cool-down session.\n\n\nAfter squats or deadlifts, you‚Äôll probably be exhausted and ready to go home. But if you‚Äôre having major leg soreness or trouble walking, it‚Äôs probably worth taking a few minutes to stretch after your leg day workout.\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to go overboard, just get a nice deep stretch on your major leg muscles before you call it a day. If it‚Äôs too late and you‚Äôre already home and feeling sore, a good stretch will still help blood flow and recovery in those muscle groups.\n---\n\n\n3. Walk, do yoga, or hit the stationary bike \n\n\nEven though you might be in pain, sitting on the couch doing nothing is probably not the right way to go.\n\n\nGetting back to the gym, if possible, and doing some light work on the stationary bike is PERFECT for leg recovery. It‚Äôs low impact, easy, and will promote great circulation.\n\n\nA gentle yoga class or a long walk are also great options.\n\n\nIt might hurt at first if your legs are really sore, but it should help alleviate the pain sooner than remaining sedentary would.\n---\n\n\n4. Ice those legs down\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre having a brutal leg day hangover, it‚Äôs because you did some serious damage to your muscles on a microscopic level. (Congrats on a great workout, by the way!)\n\n\nAs we talked about above, those little tears and abrasions are going to swell up and feel awful in the process of healing.\n\n\nSo what do you do when something swells up? You ice it down!\n\n\nAn ice pack on your legs will actually narrow the blood vessels and reduce the blood flow to the area, which will help the swelling go down and get you back on your feet.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not ideal for nutrient delivery and recovery, but it will help ease the pain.\n---\n\n\n5. Use a foam roller\n\n\nFoam rollers are a FANTASTIC accessory that can help you work out knots in your muscles, improve mobility, avoid injuries, and promote better recovery after workouts.\n\n\nWhen all else fails and the soreness is just too deep in your muscles, and especially if you‚Äôre having trouble walking, using one of these can really help loosen you back up.\n\n\nLook up a few foam rolling exercises that target your legs and pay careful attention to the technique to get the best results.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20221115"}

Dr. Mandell", "description": "Utilizing a towel as a simple yet effective tool can significantly enhance foot and leg circulation, particularly after a rigorous workout session. Following a day filled with exercises that engage the lower body, a towel can be employed for gentle stretching and massaging, which can help alleviate discomfort and promote better blood flow. To begin, you might sit comfortably on the floor or on a chair or sofa, draping the towel around the arch of your foot while holding the ends. Gently pulling the towel towards you will provide a safe stretch for the calf muscles and Achilles tendon, aiding flexibility and circulation. This stretch not only helps in loosening tight muscles but also encourages venous return, reducing the risk of developing varicose veins and minimizing swelling in the ankles and feet.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating rhythmic movements with the towel can further enhance circulation. For instance, you can perform a \"towel scrunch,\" where you place a towel on the floor and use your toes to scrunch it up towards you. This exercise engages the small muscles in the feet, stimulating blood flow and strengthening foot muscles, thus promoting overall leg health. Using the towel as a prop in various exercises, such as leg extensions or lateral leg raises, can facilitate a greater range of motion and improve circulation in the legs. By engaging in these practices regularly, you not only support your muscle recovery post-workout but also cultivate a habit that promotes long-term circulation health, helping to keep your legs feeling light and energized! Remember, integrating such mindful practices into your routine can significantly impact your overall well-being, helping to prevent discomfort and enhance the vitality of your lower extremities.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

She's answering common facial-filler questions and performing full-face rejuvenations on two of her clients. Filler is a volume inducer, mostly made out of hyaluronic acid, that helps add volume to areas that are shifting downwards because of aging. Common areas patients request are the eyes, cheeks, and lips. However, fillers can also be placed on the chin, jawline, and around the nose. \n\nClients can see a difference immediately after receiving filler, but fully healed results show in about two weeks. One syringe of filler typically costs about $500 to $1,000, and results can last a year to two years. If someone is doing a full facial lift with fillers, such as a combination of the under eyes, cheeks, lips, nasolabial folds, and jawline, that can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $10,000, and those results can last three to four years. If a client isn't happy with their results, hyaluronic acid fillers can be completely dissolved. It's important to visit a professional who will understand your face shape, ethnicity, mental and physical health concerns, and what to do if a treatment has complications.\n\nFor more, please visit Vanessa Lee:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/vanessalee_rn/\nThe Things We Do:\nhttps://thethingswedo.co/. \n\nMORE BEAUTY INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Medical Pedicures Transform Feet\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHuvDvCkbC0&t=13s\n11 Grossly Satisfying Beauty Treatments For Better Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pdzwgKFHI\nHow A Nonsurgical Face-Lift Works | Beauty Explorers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot_2tuwRR2U\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Fillers #BeautyTransformations #BeautyInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

It is even more powerful when paired with the poetry of passionate teens.  \n\nDenise Fellows, prior to SummerWorks, referred to herself as a ‚Äúsilent poet.‚Äù She said that her poetry used to ‚Äòscream so loud to be heard by someone other than her own ears.‚Äô Denise worked with SummerWorks in the summer of 2014, and it was there she began sharing her work.\n\nKira Cobbs was born in 1998 in Denver, CO. She plays the piano and practices Chinese and sign language; she also participates in her school‚Äôs poetry organization, Louder Than a Bomb. She has been writing poetry since she was inspired to do so by her fourth grade teacher. Kira participated in SummerWorks in 2014.\n\n\r\nJasmine Johnson is a sophomore at Benson High School and she participated in SummerWorks 2014.‚ÄúWe all became somewhat of a big family,‚Äù Johnson says of her experienced ‚ÄúI never for a second thought I would enjoy cleaning city parks, but if I could work at SummerWorks again I would. It was an amazing experience and opportunity.‚Äù \r\n\r\nJasmine would like to thank her 7th grade teacher, Ms. Carlson of Monroe Middle School, for introducing her to poetry. Jasmine says poetry is the reasons she is the person she is today; it has helped her through anger, depression, and other life struggles.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The results were compared with those obtained in men during continuous sleep. Although mean levels and area under the curve of testosterone were similar in both groups, fragmented sleep resulted in a significant delay in testosterone rise (03:24 h ¬± 1:13 vs. 22:35 h ¬± 0:22)\nDuring fragmented sleep, nocturnal testosterone rise was observed only in subjects who showed REM episodes (4/10) - findings indicate that the sleep-related rise in serum testosterone levels is linked with the appearance of first REM sleep. The rise in testosterone levels was slower when REM latency was longer in young adult men, testosterone levels begin to rise on falling asleep, peak at about the time of first REM, and remain at the same levels until awakening.\n\nMorning vs Evening Workouts Study - Study - journal PLoS One:\nLooked at the effect of time of day on performance, hormonal and metabolic response during a 1000-M cycling time trial in 9 recreational cyclists, average age 31. The participants performed a 1000-m TT at either 8 am or 6 pm, in randomized, repeated-measures, crossover design a 1000-m cycling time-trial. The time to complete the time trial was lower in the evening than in the morning (88.2 vs 94.7, respectively), but there was no significant different in pacing. However, oxygen uptake and aerobic mechanical power output at 600 and 1000 m tended to be higher in the evening. There was also a main effect of time of day for insulin, cortisol, and total and free testosterone concentration, which were all higher in the morning (+60%, +26%, +31% and +22%, respectively) The norepinephrine response to the exercise was increased in the morning (+46%), and it was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in the response of glucose.\n\nReferences:\n\n1) The Effect of Diurnal Variation on Clinical Measurement of Serum Testosterone and Other Sex Hormone Levels in Men.

That one is no longer available.\n\nThese types of breathing exercises can give improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance and exercise performance. \n\nInspiratory muscle training is basically a series of breathing exercises that aim to strengthen the bodies‚Äô respiratory muscles making it easier for people to breathe. When a person is breathing normally, they typically use between 10 to 15 per cent of his or her total lung capacity. However, with Inspiratory muscle training, a person can typically increase the amount of lung capacity used. \n\nA tool that can help with inspiratory muscle training is a high altitude training mask like the one from Perpetual Air featured in the video. These masks restrict air flow and can help with inspiratory muscle training. The Perpetual Air mask has various levels of air restriction that are easily adjusted.\n\nThe following exercises can be done either with our without a high altitude training mask.\n\nThe first breathing exercise is very simple. Breath in through your nose for 2 seconds and breath out through your mouth with pursed lips for 4 seconds. \n\nNow you are going to move your arms with the breathing to loosen up the muscles around your chest area. \n\nFinally, breathing with your diaphragm, or belly breathing, is a great way to relax and improve your breathing.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nBreathing Exercises for Relaxation or COPD:\nhttps://youtu.be/-7-CAFhJn78\n\n===========================================\n\nSUPPORT me on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo\n\n===========================================\n\nBreathing Exercises for COPD, Asthma, Bronchitis & Emphysema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpTNUGwXbTU\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.

Some MCU actors like Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd were far from ripped and muscular when they were cast in their respective roles. However, they put in the work to attain the fit and athletic bodies they sport on screen. This is no easy feat, as getting your body into peak shape is an incredibly difficult task. Sometimes it take‚Äôs over a year of strict dieting and workout plans to achieve their goals. And then years more maintaining this shape for future movies in the MCU.

As we get older, our testosterone tends to naturally decline. We can‚Äôt stop it completely, but we can fight back against the loss of our needed male hormones. Having less fat and more muscle is crucial for our testosterone production. When you think of building muscle, you think of resistance training and lifting weights at the gym or at home. While that is the major key for building muscle, there are some needs you need to fo to help optimize muscle growth.\n\nAside from resistance training, there are 2 more major keys for building muscle faster after 50. Recovery and getting good quality sleep is another crucial part for building muscle. That is the time when your body works on repairing the muscle fibers you damage from your workouts, helping them grow bigger during the recovery. \n\nThe last major component is nutrition. In order to build more muscle, you need to make sure that you are consuming enough protein. Protein is the most needed food group in order to build more muscle during your recovery from your workouts. There are a lot of foods you can eat, supplements you can, protein powder you can drink to get protein in your body. That is why I am going to give you 5 great foods that you can eat to help you build more muscle faster after 50.\n\nHere are the 5 foods to help you build muscle faster after 50.

Or in other words, simply figuring out how you‚Äôre going to group your exercises throughout the week. And although there isn‚Äôt one ‚Äúbest workout split‚Äù for everyone, certain muscle building splits have their advantages. For example, we know that training a muscle at least 2x/week is superior to 1x/week. This automatically makes the common bro split inferior to other higher muscle training frequency workout splits. Training splits like the upper lower split, full body workout splits (‚Äútotal body workouts‚Äù), and the push pull legs workout split train each muscle 2x/week whereas the bro split does not. This not only helps better optimize protein synthesis but also enables you to get more quality sets done since your workout volume is spread out over multiple workouts.\n\nBut which of these splits should you choose for mass? Well, it depends on your training experience. The best workout split for beginners looking to put on mass is likely a 3 day workout split with full body workouts. This is because you can train the compound lifts frequently and master them very quickly without causing too much muscle damage. Then, as you gain experience and need more volume to progress, you can switch to a 4 day workout split (such as the upper/lower split) to help spread out your volume better throughout the week. And then, as you progress even more, switching to a 5 day workout split or a 6 day workout split (push pull legs for example) would be wise to keep your workouts from being excessively long and fatiguing. However, despite what research says, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that workout volume and consistency are the more important factors. So choose the workout split that you enjoy the most and best fits your schedule ‚Äì as that‚Äôs going to be the best option for you! \n\nAnd if you‚Äôre looking for a step-by-step program that shows you how to optimize your training and nutrition in order to progress as efficiently as possible, then simply take my starting-point analysis tool below to find which program is best for you: \nhttps://builtwithscience.com/bws-free-fitness-quiz/gender?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=Video&utm_content=Description%20box&utm_campaign=Science%20based%20back%20split%20to%20maximize%20growth%20Jan%206%2F2019\n\nLINK TO WRITTEN ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/best-workout-split/ \n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM & FACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeremyethier/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Jeremyethierfit/\n\nMUSIC:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\nSTUDIES:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729395\n\nOTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES:\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/frequency-muscle/\nhttps://mennohenselmans.com/optimal-program-design/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 427, "publish_time": "20190106"}

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nThe success of Joker and Venom has completely changed the way movie studios are looking at superhero movies. No longer are our caped heroes standing front and center. With Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad coming soon, we could see a whole slate of super-villain movies hitting the big screen. Why bother trying another stab at remaking the Fantastic Four when there‚Äôs such a better character to focus on instead? Doctor Doom stood in the shadows of both Fantastic Four franchises, serving as the main villain, but not getting fleshed out enough to truly becoming a compelling part of the films. Catwoman had her shot at a solo movie with Halle Berry‚Äôs disappointing cheesefest back in 2004, but there‚Äôs another DC vixen who could really shine with a solo story -- and her name is Poison Ivy. Just the thought of Poison Ivy on the big screen has probably conjured some pretty bad memories of Batman and Robin, but let‚Äôs just pull that withered weed from the garden and start over. Despite the cheesy puns about ice, snow, and everything frozen, you cannot deny the dramatic possibilities of the Mr. Freeze origin story we saw glimpses of in the 1997 disaster Batman & Robin. Arnold Schawnegger‚Äôs portrayal of Mr. Freeze is pretty much a big joke now and has resulted in no other portrayals of the character on the big-screen, but he definitely has a great story to tell. \n\nThe Joker did a deep dive into the character‚Äôs psyche, backstory, and provided a whole new perspective on the madness behind him. But what other villains deserve a similar movie treatment? Between some Marvel juggernauts and DC villains who deserve proper big-screen treatment, let‚Äôs see who should go solo in the future!\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 635, "publish_time": "20191024"}

Initially I was a little apprehensive, worried that my drawing skills might have deteriorated during my time away.\n\nBut as I mention in the video, to my surprise they‚Äôd actually improved! I‚Äôm not sure what the exact reason behind this is, but I suspect that after getting some distance my brain had time to process everything I‚Äôd learned. So when I eventually started drawing again, it was all still there!\n\nI do feel like my work has a bit more rhythm to it now, which feels great. I‚Äôm not thinking about it, or judging it as much anymore. I‚Äôm not too concerned about the small things. The creation process seems to have become quite fluid for me as of recently and I‚Äôm thankful for that.\n\nThe idea for this character design sketch came about after I‚Äôd spent long enough thinking about an idea that had been fermenting inside my mind for the last few months. It was an idea for a comic book, and the more I thought about it, the more complete it became.\n\nEventually I‚Äôd somehow worked out an entire plot in my head without writing anything down at all, and at that point I figured hey, why not put pencil to paper and see if I can‚Äôt come up with a few cool character concepts for this story?\n\nThe character in this video is one of the key players in the plot. He works at a robotics plant where he manufactures bio mechanical replacement bodies for people to transfer their consciousness to when their organic bodies become obsolete. \n\nThe catch is that these body replacements, otherwise known as capsules, are reserved only for the wealthy and the powerful. \nSo of course this character, being a mere engineer at a manufacturing plant would never be able get his hands on one of these bio mechanical bodies, which is unfortunate for him because it just so happens that his younger brother is terminally ill with a rare disease that can‚Äôt be cured. \n\nHowever, he loves his brother and would do anything to save him ‚Äì so he does the unthinkable, illegally uploading his brothers consciousness into a capsule which does not belong to him.\n\nIn fact, this capsule has been set aside and belongs to one of the most powerful and feared gangsters in the entire city. And that‚Äôs just the beginning of the story! But I‚Äôll leave it there for now. I don‚Äôt want to give away too much just yet ‚Äì especially because I have no idea when I‚Äôll get round to actually putting this comic together!\n\nI hope you enjoy the video! \n\nThanks for watching! \n-Clayton\n\nSoftware Used: Manga Studio\n\nIf you like the video, show your support by commenting, sharing or subscribing. \n\nComic Art Community - https://www.howtodrawcomics.net/comic-art-community/\nHow to Draw Comics .NET - http://www.howtodrawcomics.net/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/howtodrawcomics/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/howtodrawcomics\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/howtodrawcomics\nTumblr - http://howtodrawcomics.tumblr.com/\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/howtodrawcomics/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1271, "publish_time": "20190409"}

Strangely satisfying", "description": "Chill out for 10 mins and let us do the work.\n\nI use timelapse filming mainly to prove to myself that at the end of the day I have actually done some work! Most of these shots cover several hours of digging condensed into just a matter of seconds- but when you're in the woods digging, especially if you're alone, progress can seem painfully slow sometimes! Making a big landing takes so much effort, the volume of dirt alone can mean hundreds, maybe thousands of wheelbarrows to fill, move and empty. \n\nI find that filming a timelapse stops me from getting lazy - if I stop digging to call or message someone it looks very obvious in the shot. You have to keep busy and keep moving. It's a good way of making sure you don't stop until the job is done. I generally set myself a target of something to achieve and then don't go home until it's done- even if it means getting lights out of my car and digging into the night. \n\nThis video is a mash-up of some of the timelapses I have shot over the last few years either of me alone (cheeky week day visits) or with the crew all digging together on Sunday. Even tho we're hopefully nearing the point when we can all return to our local trail spots- it's been weeks since I have ridden or done any digging. I plan to ease myself back into things and spend more time on a shovel than a bike for a while. \n\nReally hope you enjoy the video... Next week's video is a little different from the norm so look out for that one!\n\nTake it easy - oh yeah and subscribe ;-)", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 545, "publish_time": "20200515"}

After completing a two-year journey in our Airstream to see all 50 states and 51 National Parks, we left to travel abroad. We have downsized our possessions and sold our home so that we can wander about with only the things in our backpacks. \n\nWe love living on the road, traveling each week to a new location. We plan to travel extensively to every part of the world. Ours is not a slow travel lifestyle but rather a vagabondish one. The goal is not to check a country off a list, but to experience it by meeting new people, seeing how others live, and making new friends. We believe in laughing, loving, and living our lives to the fullest. \n\nWe are working hard to build a beautiful website where you can get travel information about the places we have been. In addition, we post blog articles to help you travel better. Our channel is a way of augmenting that effort, so sometimes we post videos about how to travel or a vlog showing our lives on the road as we do an activity or an adventure. We also post Shorts, so check those out, too. We hope to entertain you, but most importantly, we want to inspire you and give you the confidence to plan your own adventure around the world. \n\nVideo # 128\n\nWe invite you to subscribe and comment.

This is just the spot to cool off after a day on the beach. Laze around the pool, or move to the shaded deck upstairs and enjoy burgers fresh off the grill seated at the covered dining area. You can even watch your favorite sports channel on the outdoor TV.\n\nBe sure to turn the lights on around the pool at night and see how beautiful it is .\n\nThere are child protective gates on both levels of the house, so young children will not be able to access the pool area without an adult opening the gate.\n\nJumping and diving are not permitted and there should always be adult supervision when there are children in the pool.\n\nWhen the kids get tired of swimming in the pool they can move to the garage and play ping pong and fuss ball. You can open the garage door and then lower a screened door to allow for ventilation. And just in case the kids work up a thirst there is a small refrigerator there also. This is handy for the pool area too, so you don't have to go back to the house for cold drinks.\n\nThe outdoor shower with hot and cold water is just outside the garage - perfect for getting all the sand off before hitting the pool!\n\nThe kitchen is super well stocked and has everything you will need to prepare meals for your group. It has a breakfast bar with additional seating just in case there is not enough room for everyone round the dining table.\n\nThe 3 bedrooms consist of a king in the master bedroom with TV, large walk in closet and en suite bathroom.\n\nThe second bedroom has a queen bed and TV and the third bedroom is ideal for kids with a bunk bed with a single on top and a double below - and then there is even another bed that pulls out. The kids will love it! And they also have their own TV!\n\nThe den downstairs is comfy and cozy with an electric fireplace, 65 inch TV, games for the kids and there is also a queen sleeper sofa for those extra guests.\n\nThe third bathroom and laundry is also on this level and is convenient to the pool - no need to go all the way upstairs.\n\nOf course the house has ceiling fans in all rooms, wifi, pool toys and chairs for the beach with a buggy to transport them over. It literally takes about 3 minutes to walk from the house to the closest beach access - it is really no distance at all.\n\nThe house is dog friendly for most breeds with a 40 pound limit on size. You will have to show proof of vet prescribed flea medication and provide covers to protect furniture and bedding from pet hair.\n\nThree grocery stores are near by and the historic downtown is about 10 minutes by car, so the situation is ideal and this house really offers everything possible to make this your best vacation ever!", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 303, "publish_time": "20190627"}

Particularly ones that are very time efficient and effective.\n\nThe Top Health Benefits of Aerobic Exercise (0:44)\n\n#1 Helps Build a Stronger Immune System\n\nMost guys don‚Äôt know that consistent aerobic exercise is research-proven to keep your immune system strong and help your body ward off common illnesses like the flu or a cold.\n\n#2 Great Way to Burn Fat\n\nAerobics also increase your fat-burning capacity ‚Äì long after you‚Äôre done exercising: By regularly doing aerobic exercise, your muscles develop a higher number of mitochondria, which help you burn more fat at rest ‚Äì even when you‚Äôre not exercising.\n\n#3 Correlated with a Longer Lifespan\n\nAerobics help you live longer: According to the newest scientific research, those who engage in aerobic exercise live longer than those who do not.\n\n#4 Helps Improve Your Brain Function\n\nAerobics makes you smarter: New research also shows that aerobics increases your brain‚Äôs production of a molecule called Irisin that improves memory and protects our brains against degeneration.\n\n#5 Improves Cardiovascular Health\n\nAerobics makes your heart stronger: Aerobics train your heart to beat more efficiently, so your heart doesn‚Äôt have to work as hard. \n\nThat‚Äôs why aerobically fit people have lower heart rates than non-fit people. In fact, elite athletes often have resting heart rates as low as 40 beats per minute (the average man over 40 is 90bpm).\n\n#6 Decreases Chance of Disease\n\nAerobics ward off most major health risks: Studies also show that aerobics helps reduce your risk of diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure.\n\nHow to Get Started With Aerobic Exercise (4:20)\n\nNow, after understanding these top benefits of aerobic exercise, it‚Äôs also important to look at the best practice for aerobic exercise. Because for those of us with busy schedules, it can be pretty difficult to fit in an hour or two each day of light jogging or running on the treadmill to get these benefits. But thankfully, as you‚Äôll discover in this video, there is a much more time-efficient way to get started with aerobic exercise and still see the amazing effects.\n\n#1 Daily Walking\n#2 Regular Cardio\n#3 Strength & Cardio Circuit Training\n\nSo I hope this guide leaves you with some added motivation to incorporate more aerobic exercise into your routine, and some simple ideas on how to get started. Because once you do, I think you‚Äôll find that aerobic exercise is an essential part of creating the healthy lifestyle you‚Äôre working towards, and it doesn‚Äôt have to eat up a ton of time to make it happen.\n\nIf you feel your lifestyle could use an improvement, then check out our FF30X 30-Day Transformation Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-ff30x-program\nIf you want to start putting on muscle TODAY, check out our Fit Father Old School Muscle Building Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-osm-program\n\nYour friends here at the FFP, \n\n-Dr. Balduzzi + The Men's Health Experts @ The Fit Father Project\n\n**Disclaimer: This information is for reference purposes ONLY and cannot replace personal information you can and should discuss with your Doctor.

Most people think that one only needs to get the right color at the right place but there is an almost infinite number of ways to apply the same color at the same spot and this is where the difference between beginners and masters lies.\nTypically, a beginner will use a very limited selection of paint application techniques: the movement of the brush will most likely come from the fingers and the brush is usually held like a pencil, near the ferrule, which limits the amplitude of the stroke. Very often, the angle of the brush related to the canvas is close to 90¬∞and the pressure is usually stronger than needed, similar to writing. \nObviously, we all went through this and it‚Äôs perfectly normal to have a more limited range of techniques at first. For a beginner, you see, painting is so new that it feels reassuring to start with a paint handling technique that feels familiar, that‚Äôs why the most common thing is to to hold the brush like a pencil. Everybody knows how to write and draw with a pencil so, when you take a paintbrush in your hand, it feels natural to hold it like a pencil.\nAnd let‚Äôs say it right away, it‚Äôs fine ! This way of holding the brush is perfectly adapted for details and finitions, the only problem is‚Ä¶ not everything can be about details and precision. Imagine that you visit a museum and can only look at the paintings through a magnifying glass, that would be a very poor experience because you‚Äôd miss the whole context.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 The problem most beginners have\n01:45  78,732 ways to apply the same color\rat the same spot\n06:44 Break\n07:11 Control the amount of paint in your brush\n07:45 Visualize your brush stroke \n08:53 Not happy?

I cant wait to use that technique again. I was inspired by Chris Dunn for that particular technique, he has a few instagram videos showing how he does it. \n\nIf you have any questions please ask in the comments. \n\n‚ú• The Quote I reference/butcher: \nGod has loved us without being loved, but we love Him because we are loved. We cannot be of\nany profit to Him, nor love Him with this first love. Yet God demands of us, that as He has loved us without any second thoughts, so He should be loved by us. In what way can we do this, then, since He demands it of us and we cannot give it to Him? I tell you: through a means which He has established by which we can love Him freely, and without the least regard to any profit of ours: we can be useful, not to Him, which is impossible, but to our neighbour...To show the love we have to Him, we ought to serve and love every rational creature...Every virtue receives life from love, and love is gained in love, that is, by raising the eye of our mind to behold how much we are beloved of God. Seeing ourselves loved, we cannot do otherwise than love...So thou seest that we conceive virtues through God and bring them to the birth for our neighbour.\n-- Saint Catherine of Sienna", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 788, "publish_time": "20240619"}

{"cate": ["Howto & Style"], "query": null, "uploader": "Chris Breier", "uploader_id": "@ChrisBreier", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmaYj7TEwB4", "video_id": "wmaYj7TEwB4", "title": "How to Blend Acrylics Like Oils", "description": "Amazon CHAPTERS\nClick on the time stamp to jump to a specific chapter\n0:00 Introduction\n0:15 Using OPEN acrylics or regular acrylics with retarder\n2:00 How to create smooth blends with acrylics\n5:02 Creating soft edges with acrylics\n8:32 How to keep acrylic paint wet on the palette\n9:53 Finishing touches\n10:22 the finished still life painting\n\nIn this video, I demonstrate how to blend acrylics in a manner that's similar to oils. The secret to blending acrylics is to use acrylic retarder to prevent the paint from drying out too soon. I prefer to use Golden OPEN acrylics because the retarder is already mixed into the paint.\n\nI usually blend acrylics after I apply the colors to the canvas. Another tip is to blend the paint with a soft brush. \n\nI also demonstrate how to create soft edges with acrylics. Soft edges have a blurry, out of focus appearance to them. The soft edges make the hard edges stand out more. This is a way to guide the viewers eye to the focal point.\n\nJudging the colors while placing them on a white canvas can be tricky. I find that I have to adjust the values as the painting progresses.\n\nART SUPPLIES & TOOLS USED IN THIS VIDEO\nAll of the links that lead to Blick Art Materials or Amazon are affiliate links. This means that if you click on a link and make a purchase, I earn a commission at no cost to you.\n\nGOLDEN OPEN ACRYLICS\nI used Golden OPEN acrylics for this painting. They're convenient because the retarder is already in the paint, in the proper proportions. The link below contains sets of small tubes of OPEN acrylics so you can try them out, or you can buy the standard sized tubes of individual colors.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5m9\n\nTHE COLORS I USED IN THIS PAINTING\nTitanium White \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcp\nAmazon https://amzn.to/334LyRp\n\nQuinacridone Magenta \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcq\nAmazon https://amzn.to/34rtEt7\n\nUltramarine Blue \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcs\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3f7k9RX\n\nHansa Yellow Opaque \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcu\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3sYSB9w\n\nCarbon Black \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcx\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3qRnNoe\n\nACRYLIC RETARDERS\nYou can add retarder to any brand of acrylics to make them dry slower. This is useful if you already have a brand of acrylics that you prefer. Follow the instructions, you usually don't want to add any more than 25%-30% retarder because it may take too long to dry. The paint may remain tacky even after it dries if you add too much. \n\nGolden Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5mc\nLiquitex Slo-Dri Medium http://shrsl.com/2j5me\nWinsor & Newton Galeria Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5mi\nGrumbacher Artists Acrylic Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5ml\n\nBRUSHES\nI use mostly synthetic brushes that are made for acrylics like these ones from Robert Simmons\nhttp://shrsl.com/3a082\nThe softer brushes are for watercolor.\n\nACRYLIC PALETTES\nThe Masterson Stay Wet Palette is a large plastic box with a tight fitting lid. It comes with a sponge and palette paper. I find that I don't need the sponge to keep the OPEN acrylics wet, but you may need to use it if you live in a very hot and dry climate. It works better than a Tupperware container because the sides of the wall are lower, and it's large. Here is the 12\"x16\" Masterson Palette I use in the video http://shrsl.com/2j5n4\n\nThis is the smaller palette that I store inside of the Masterson Palette.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5nc\n\nSince the OPEN acrylics stay wet for so long, I never really have to peel the paint off. I just clean it with a wet paper towel or rag. I find the microfiber towels work great.\n\nMICROFIBER TOWELS\nI bought a large package of these on Amazon, the link is below. The small fibers create more surface area than paper towels and they do seem to make it easier to clean things. They work great for drying paint brushes and cleaning palettes. Make sure that you handle them properly if you use them with oil paints because they can spontaneously combust.\nhttps://amzn.to/2GdvMsn\n\nTABLE TOP EASEL\nThis is where you can buy the easel I use in the video:\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5ni\n\nI have been using this table top easel for some time now and I like how portable it is. The top folds down and it has a handle which makes it easy to carry. The drawer on the bottom opens to the side and the inside is divided into separate compartments for storing pencils, brushes, and tubes of paint.\n\nPAINT SPATULA\nThis paint spatula from Princeton is handy tool to have in the studio.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5no\n\nCANVAS PANELS\nI've tried out a number or brands of canvas panels, but I'm really fond of the ones made by Raymar. They're acrylic primed and they're backed with a gray melamine that makes them even more resistant to warping.

You know the feeling when you‚Äôre half way through a painting and it isn‚Äôt working out? Maybe it‚Äôs not the values, drawing or the colour - very likely it‚Äôs just that the set up was put together too quickly without a lot of thought.\n\nSo it's really worth takng some time to learn how to set up a still life. Good still life paintings (and most paintings, really) rely on the pattern of lights and darks, and you can create that before you even squeeze out any paint by carefully putting together the still life composition on your stand. If it looks beautiful before you start painting, you have a much better chance of getting a beautiful painting when you‚Äôre finished.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1052, "publish_time": "20210123"}

It produced reasonable power from 1250rpm and crested at around 4500rpm, providing a near perfect torque band before reaching the speed cutoff at 7000rpm. \n\nBecause BMW intended the engine to function reliably and retain the feel of a much larger v8, throttle lag was practically non-existent (for a turbo engine). \n\nThe N55 prefers higher octane gasoline because it provides more power and better efficiency, with most users saying that the expense per mile is the same as when using low octane fuel. \n\nThe N54 and N55 engines were identical in many ways, but the most notable change was that the later N55 model had a contemporary single twinscroll turbine, as opposed to the N54's twin-turbocharger.\n\nA single turbo is less expensive, lighter, and has a few advantages, but the twin-turbo configuration provides more possible power increases from upgrades. However, the benefits of a bigger single twin scroll turbo are still substantial and sufficient for most tuning tasks. Surprisingly, Alpina chose a twin turbo system in their performance versions. Generally, the N55 improved on the N54 and was in production from 2009 to 2015, when it was superseded by the B57 engine. \n\nWith the introduction of the Alpina tuned models we saw the N55 factory power varies from a respectable 302 bhp to 425 bhp and with mapping adjustments it is possible to add around 80hp on the basic engine.\n\nAir Induction kits and Exhaust will NOT usually ADD TORQUE for most stock N55 configurations on their own, but they will allow you to increase power after other improvements by removing the limitation you hit with other mods as the factory setup runs out of capacity to cope. \n\nFlowing and porting the Head - Flowing and porting the head will get air streaming into the engine while eliminating turbulence or limitations. \n\nTurbo upgrades - forced induction is the most important method to increase the air flow to your intake, enabling you to consume more gasoline and gain power. \n\nN55 remapping offers the most power for the money, but new ECUs and integrated Tuning boxes are also options.\n\nChapters\n0:00 Intro\n2:34 Spark Plug Selection\n3:00 Intercoolers\n4:07 Turbo Upgrades\n6:00 Fuel - Port Injection Fuel Types\n6:17 Engine Tuning (Remapping)\n8:08 Induction Kits & Intakes\n9:05 Head Work Gas Flowing Valves\n10:15 Stronger Engine Parts\n11:11 Injector Upgrades\n12:02 Exhaust Mods \n14:20 Forged Crank Pistons\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IG-bqFLaujU?t=181 Intercoolers\n\nThe following cars came with the N55 engine: 2009‚Äì2017 F10/F11/F07 535i, 2010‚Äì2013 E90/E91/E92/E93 335i, 2010‚Äì2013 E82/E88 135i, 2010‚Äì2017 F25 X3 xDrive35i, 2011‚Äì2013 E70 X5 xDrive35i, 2011‚Äì2015 F30/F31 335i, 2011‚Äì2014 E71 X6 xDrive35i, 2012‚Äì2015 E84 X1 xDrive35i, 2013‚Äì2016 F32/F33/F36 435i, 2014‚Äì2018 F15 X5 xDrive35i, 2014‚Äì2019 F16 X6 xDrive35i, and 2014‚Äì2016 F26 X4 xDrive35i.

It was the custom shop behind the first really mainstream car show, Pimp My Ride, and since Pimp My  Ride ended the shop has gone on to be behind another car show named Inside West Coast Customs. \n\nThe shop has a very interesting history too and is probably the one shop in the world that does not have an exact founding date. According to some, the shop was founded way back in 1994, and others say it was 1997.\n\nIn any case, what we do know for sure is that the shop was incorporated in the year 2000 by Ryan Friedlinghaus, a young mechanic who had a passion for building custom made cars. \n\nHowever, Friedlinghaus had discovered quite early in his life that there were almost no garages that could do all everything needed to make a custom car in-house. \n\nSo he created West Coast Customs as a shop that could make custom cars from top to bottom without outsourcing any part of the vehicle. That was his vision for West Coast Customs, and for a while, that was precisely what the shop was. \n\nAt first, the shop did not get a lot of orders, but soon celebrities like Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal started bringing their expensive cars around for custom effects and that is when West Coast Customs blew up.\n\nBefore long, the shop drew the attention of media giants MTV and they pitched the show Pimp My Ride to Friedlinghaus. But here was the catch, Friedlinghaus was not going to be the host of the show. It would merely be hosted in his shop and he would be the one to coordinate the actual work on the vehicles. The real host of the show would be a rapper named Xzibit. \n\nIn the end, Pimp My Ride was a successful show, but after the first few years, West Coast Customs started seeing the first problems that would eventually run the shop out of reality TV shows forever. \n\n#InsideWestCoastCustoms", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 507, "publish_time": "20220627"}

First off, there's not a single Porsche part on the car.\n\nPorsche Engineering Services helped with reengineering the W124's engine compartment to fit in the 32-valve, 4-cam M119 V-8 ‚Äî for both the 400E and the 500E.\n\nBut the 500E doesn't use the same V-8 as the 500SL. It needed shorter connecting rods so that it fit in the same physical space as the 4.2-liter 400E ‚Äî this way only one structural variant needed to be produced.\n\nThe 400E was a response to the Lexus LS400. Why do you think it wasn't called a 420E?\n\nPorsche also did the engineering to bolt up wheels, tires, brakes, and suspension components from the wider and heavier R129 500SL and W124 500SEL. That necessitated fender flares so wide that the 500E didn't fit down the regular W124 production line in Sindelfingen. \n\nFor both models, Porsche performed the physical modifications to Mercedes-built W124 chassis, and sent them back to Sindelfingen for paint. The 400E remained there, but because of its width, the 500E was sent back to Porsche, which assembled the 500E at a second Zuffenhausen factory.\n\nWith Bruno Sacco's revolutionary looks, aerodynamics, obsession with safety, and Mercedes build quality and engineering might, the W124 was certainly among the best (and most expensive) sedans in the world.\n\nStill is. It's close to perfect. But it's not a Porsche Sports Sedan.\n\n=\n\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

If you‚Äôre looking for a simple yet very effective way of losing weight and improving your overall health, walking is something just for you. \nPeople who are physically active throughout their life are much less prone to this disease than those who have a more sedentary lifestyle. And that‚Äôs because they have more volume in their hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning.   \nA daily half-hour walk helps avoid serious problems, like coronary heart disease to name one, by lowering high blood pressure and cholesterol levels and improving blood circulation. Because of better-quality and deeper breathing, some symptoms associated with lung disease can show significant improvement thanks to walking. \nMuscle tone and weight loss is also totally achievable through simple walking. Find your optimal pace, but don‚Äôt break out into a jog. This sort of speed walking is low impact and doesn‚Äôt require any recovery time, which means no sore muscles to keep you from getting out and walking the next day.\nThe Arthritis Foundation recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate walking a day to reduce pain, stiffness, and inflammation in the joints. Building strong bones will help you prevent osteoporosis and reduce bone loss. Walking contributes to better blood circulation within the spinal structures, pumping important nutrients into the soft tissues and improving posture and flexibility, both of which are vital for a healthy spine.\nA group of researchers at Iowa State University worked with hundreds of college students. Walking changed their mood for the better, even though no one warned them it could do so.\nIf you still don‚Äôt feel motivated enough to start walking for your health, try joining a class or find a buddy who also wouldn‚Äôt mind getting all the benefits of walking. Another idea could be to hire a personal trainer.\n\nMusic: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music\n\nTIMESTAMPS\nBrain-boosting effect 0:45\nImproved eyesight 1:44\nPrevention of heart disease 2:47\nIncreased lung volume 3:14\nBenefits for the pancreas 3:51\nImproved digestion 4:23\nToned muscles 4:59\nSturdier bones and joints 5:45\nBack pain relief 6:10\nA calmer mind 7:04\nBonus: the FIT formula 8:00\n\nSUMMARY\n-Walking prevents the early onset of dementia, reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and improves your overall mental well-being by reducing stress and releasing endorphins.\n-Get on the road to improve vision and protect your eyes now from potential problems, such as glaucoma, in the future. \n-Walking is no less effective than running when it comes to the prevention of heart disease and stroke.\n-Walking is an aerobic exercise, which means that it increases oxygen flow in the bloodstream and helps eliminate toxins and waste, which is great for your lungs. \n-Walking for exercise is a surprisingly more effective way to prevent diabetes than running is.\n-Just half an hour of walking every day not only lowers the risk of developing colon cancer but also improves digestion and regulates bowel movements.\n-Just 10,000 steps a day can be just as effective as a full-blown workout at the gym, especially if you add some intervals or uphill walking.\n-Walking can provide more joint mobility, prevent the loss of bone density, and even reduce the risk of fractures.\n-Walking is a real life-saver for those who experience back pain during more challenging high-impact exercises.\n-Walking improves depression symptoms in patients with MDD, just imagine how easily it could help us cope with just feeling down or exhausted.\n-Keep in mind the FIT formula.

However, is this a valid perspective? Well, to determine if heavy and light weight training cause different effects, we need to look at the research. After reviewing the research out there, it seems that using heavy or light weights actually doesn‚Äôt matter much in terms of hypertrophy. Studies show that muscle growth tends to be equal despite using light weights or heavy weights (high rep vs low rep). But this is only true when going to near failure, and one benefit of lifting heavy weights is the better strength gains you see when compared to light weights. Based on this, as you‚Äôll see in my video, your best bet is to incorporate high reps with light weights AND low reps with heavy weights into your workout. This will enable you to target both metabolic stress and mechanical tension; both are important mechanisms of muscle growth. \n\nLIGHT WEIGHTS VS HEAVY WEIGHTS ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/light-weights-heavy-weights/ \n\n You can browse around my website and read the articles I do have up (I‚Äôll be adding more articles on a regular basis).

Dr. Mandell", "description": "Engaging in calf pumps while seated offers an array of health benefits that extend far beyond simple leg exercise. Firstly, this activity significantly enhances circulation by utilizing the \"muscle pump\" mechanism. When the calf muscles contract, they compress the veins running through them, effectively pushing blood upward towards the heart. The one-way valves in these veins prevent the blood from flowing back down, ensuring efficient venous return and reducing the risk of blood pooling, swelling, and conditions like varicose veins. Improved circulation means that oxygen and nutrients are more effectively delivered throughout the body, supporting overall cellular function and health.\n\nAdditionally, calf pumps play a crucial role in blood sugar regulation. The muscle contractions increase glucose uptake from the bloodstream into the muscle cells, where it is used for energy, thereby helping to lower blood sugar levels. This process also improves insulin sensitivity, meaning the body requires less insulin to manage blood glucose levels effectively. Enhanced insulin sensitivity is particularly beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, as it helps to maintain more stable blood sugar levels and reduces the risk of postprandial glucose spikes.\n\nMoreover, calf pumps can significantly aid in digestion. The improved circulation ensures that digestive organs receive a better supply of oxygen and nutrients, which enhances their functionality. The physical activity also stimulates the autonomic nervous system, promoting peristalsis‚Äîthe wave-like contractions that move food through the digestive tract. This helps to prevent common digestive issues such as bloating and constipation, leading to more efficient digestion and nutrient absorption.\n\nIncorporating regular calf pumps while seated can also help reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition that can occur during prolonged periods of inactivity, such as long flights or desk jobs. By promoting blood flow and reducing stasis in the veins, calf pumps serve as a preventative measure against this potentially serious condition. Additionally, improved lymphatic circulation facilitated by these exercises aids in the removal of metabolic waste products, contributing to overall better health and reduced inflammation.\n\nIn summary, the simple act of performing calf pumps while seated offers numerous health benefits, including enhanced circulation, improved blood sugar regulation and insulin sensitivity, better digestion, and protection against conditions like DVT. This easy-to-implement activity is a powerful tool for maintaining and improving overall health, especially for individuals who spend extended periods sitting.\n\n****************************************************\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

This video provides information about the cerebellum connection.  All balancing exercises in this video are inspired by the book ADHD 2.0 by Edward Hallowell and John Ratey.  The balancing exercises in this video target the cerebellum and the vestibular system of the inner ear. These two areas combined are referred to as the vestibulo cerebellar system.  Compelling evidence from research citings in this book suggest that strengthening this system not only improves physical skill but also attention and focus and emotional regulation. Chapter three of this book goes into detail regarding the cerebellum connection. What interested me the most about this connection is the affect of calming emotions.  I've personally tried balancing exercises with children who struggle with emotional dysregulation and I've seen first had how the balancing is used as a \"bottom up\" regulation tool that younger children can access to help bring balance to an emotionally hijacked brain. Since their frontal lobes are so underdeveloped (the frontal lobes are used for \"top down\" regulation techniques), this is an exciting intervention for them to experience.  The book introduces the concept of stimulating the cerebellum through balance to regulate emotions and increase focus and attention. Since reading ADHD 2.0 I have introduced all the children and teens I work with to balancing exercises and I made this video for them to practice over the summer and outside of school hours.  This is just an introduction to some of the most popular balancing activities.

This all happens in the blink of an eye. Even at a younger age you will see people who play sports can do this much faster and land much more safely than people who do not play sport. This is a skill that can be trained and needs constant exposure to maintain it's fast response. A very slow response is what you see with an older person who has not spent time developing skills of balance, agility and power. The chance of a injury from a fall is very likely. \n\n\nMost of the current core workouts is all about training abdominal muscles in isolation using crunches, planks, and various other floor based exercises. The belief here is that if you train your core like you would with a bicep curl to make a bicep stronger, you will have improved balance and function. Unfortunately it does not work this way at all. For starters there is no need for fast reflex reactions as you are already on the floor. Secondly, planks and other traditional abdominal exercises are of little use to the older adult and more likely to cause more harm than good for these exercises are all about stiffness and rigidity. The older adult already has too much stiffness and rigidity, they do not need more.\n\nThe key is in using exercises that demand a reflex response that can teach them more effective ways to restore balance and stability.\n\nWe know the amazing benefits of agility training with sports for improving reaction times and reflex skills. The same is true for older adults but instead of improved sporting performance we may be able to save their life!\n\nStatistics in the US show that one adult over the age of 65 is treated in the emergency room for a fall every 18 seconds (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Quite an alarming statistic and even more scary when you consider that hip fractures are the most common injury from a fall and the number one cause of nursing home admission. Approximately 50% of those who suffer a hip fracture never fully regain their mobility and independence, and 50% of those die within the first year! Falling for an older adult is a very serious matter, and a life threatening situation. \n\nOther great articles to read about this subject are below\n\nStability Training What Is It Really & How To Do It\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/246-stability-training-what-is-it-really-why-is-it-so-important\n\nStrength Training For Older Adults\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/179-can-you-slow-the-ageing-process-with-exercise\n\nReduce Arthritis & Improve Bone Density\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/214-how-to-reduce-arthritis-symptoms-improve-overall-bone-density\n\nAnd if you live in Melbourne and would like to know more about our specific Older Adults Strength Training program go to our website in the link below\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/187-stronger-for-longer-older-adults-training", "quality": "1440x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20190221"}

You see, the core is generally made up of four key components. Namely - the rectus abdominus (6pack / lower abs), obliques, the serratus anterior, and the transverse abdominus (inner abs).\n\nüëâCoaching Programs: https://www.fraserwilsonfitness.com\n\nThe obliques are an absolute must when it comes to developing an aesthetic physique. If your goal is to attain the V tapered look, there‚Äôs no way around training them. The obliques are a multifunctional muscle, they act to pull the chest downwards and compress the abdominal cavity, as well as performing side bending and opposing side rotation. Overall, you can‚Äôt skimp on your obliques for aesthetic and performance, and the best way to ensure that you stay on track is to keep your workouts fresh & challenging\n\nThe serratus is a muscle that originates on your upper rib cage and attaches to the media border of the shoulder blade (basically the shark gill looking things). The serratus muscles play a pivotal role in framing out your abs, obliques and lower pec. Not too mention, it absolutely serves as an asset to the v taper, in turn giving you a better looking set of abs!\n\nThis video is full length which means you can just follow along with whatever I'm doing.

You've come to the right place!\n\n\n---\n\n\nWhy do you get so sore after leg day?\n\n\nWe know that our muscles get sore when we work them hard, whether that‚Äôs through lifting heavy weights, doing tons of reps, or burning them out through long or intense cardio.\n\n\nBut why do legs get more sore than your other muscles? \n\n\nThe simple answer is that there are many muscles in your legs, and they‚Äôre quite large‚Ä¶ which means it‚Äôs a lot harder for them to recover.\n\n\nThere are two different kinds of muscle soreness you should be aware of.\n\n\nThe first kind of muscle soreness is acute, or immediate soreness. As you challenge your muscles, they build up lactic acid, which is what causes the familiar ‚Äúburning sensation‚Äù you get right before your muscles fail.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs this quick onset soreness that you feel in the gym, between sets, or right after you finish your workout.\n\n\nIt typically won‚Äôt last more than a few minutes, or at worst, a few hours after you finish working out.\n\n\nThe second kind of muscle soreness, and the kind that can make leg day miserable, is delayed soreness, often called DOMS or Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.\n\n\nDOMS is exactly what it sounds like, and it explains why your legs are so sore the next day or two after a tough leg workout.\n\n\nOn a physiological level, the process of lifting weights and building muscle involves causing lots of microscopic tears in your muscle fibers. When these tears are repaired through rest, nutrition, and recovery, you build new muscle and gain strength.\n\n\nBut in the meantime, it can hurt‚Ä¶ a lot! The micro-tears in your muscles will swell, become inflamed, and cause you some pain while they‚Äôre recovering.\n\n\nMost experts believe DOMS are worse in your legs because of the large size of the muscle groups, and the fact that you‚Äôll lift heavier loads than you would during, say, a bicep curl.\n\n\nSo now that you understand a little bit of the science behind leg soreness, you know that it‚Äôs totally normal, and is often a sign of a great workout!\n\n\nBut what can you do to ease that soreness? Here are 5 tips that might help.\n----\n1. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate\n\n\nThis is a good idea on almost any day, but it counts double for recovering from leg day.\n\n\nMake sure you hydrate plenty before, during, and after your workout, as well as in the days following it while you recover.\n\n\nProper hydration helps your muscles heal and delivers nutrients to the parts of your body that need it the most.\n\n\nThere‚Äôs no hard and fast rule for this, but you‚Äôll sometimes see health experts recommend the 8 by 8 approach ‚Äî that‚Äôs eight 8 ounce glasses of water every day.\n---\n\n\n2. Stretch out those quads and hammies!\n\n\nMost people know the importance of properly warming up, but just as important (and probably even more likely to be skipped) is a good cool-down session.\n\n\nAfter squats or deadlifts, you‚Äôll probably be exhausted and ready to go home. But if you‚Äôre having major leg soreness or trouble walking, it‚Äôs probably worth taking a few minutes to stretch after your leg day workout.\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to go overboard, just get a nice deep stretch on your major leg muscles before you call it a day. If it‚Äôs too late and you‚Äôre already home and feeling sore, a good stretch will still help blood flow and recovery in those muscle groups.\n---\n\n\n3. Walk, do yoga, or hit the stationary bike \n\n\nEven though you might be in pain, sitting on the couch doing nothing is probably not the right way to go.\n\n\nGetting back to the gym, if possible, and doing some light work on the stationary bike is PERFECT for leg recovery. It‚Äôs low impact, easy, and will promote great circulation.\n\n\nA gentle yoga class or a long walk are also great options.\n\n\nIt might hurt at first if your legs are really sore, but it should help alleviate the pain sooner than remaining sedentary would.\n---\n\n\n4. Ice those legs down\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre having a brutal leg day hangover, it‚Äôs because you did some serious damage to your muscles on a microscopic level. (Congrats on a great workout, by the way!)\n\n\nAs we talked about above, those little tears and abrasions are going to swell up and feel awful in the process of healing.\n\n\nSo what do you do when something swells up? You ice it down!\n\n\nAn ice pack on your legs will actually narrow the blood vessels and reduce the blood flow to the area, which will help the swelling go down and get you back on your feet.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not ideal for nutrient delivery and recovery, but it will help ease the pain.\n---\n\n\n5. Use a foam roller\n\n\nFoam rollers are a FANTASTIC accessory that can help you work out knots in your muscles, improve mobility, avoid injuries, and promote better recovery after workouts.\n\n\nWhen all else fails and the soreness is just too deep in your muscles, and especially if you‚Äôre having trouble walking, using one of these can really help loosen you back up.\n\n\nLook up a few foam rolling exercises that target your legs and pay careful attention to the technique to get the best results.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20221115"}

Dr. Mandell", "description": "Utilizing a towel as a simple yet effective tool can significantly enhance foot and leg circulation, particularly after a rigorous workout session. Following a day filled with exercises that engage the lower body, a towel can be employed for gentle stretching and massaging, which can help alleviate discomfort and promote better blood flow. To begin, you might sit comfortably on the floor or on a chair or sofa, draping the towel around the arch of your foot while holding the ends. Gently pulling the towel towards you will provide a safe stretch for the calf muscles and Achilles tendon, aiding flexibility and circulation. This stretch not only helps in loosening tight muscles but also encourages venous return, reducing the risk of developing varicose veins and minimizing swelling in the ankles and feet.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating rhythmic movements with the towel can further enhance circulation. For instance, you can perform a \"towel scrunch,\" where you place a towel on the floor and use your toes to scrunch it up towards you. This exercise engages the small muscles in the feet, stimulating blood flow and strengthening foot muscles, thus promoting overall leg health. Using the towel as a prop in various exercises, such as leg extensions or lateral leg raises, can facilitate a greater range of motion and improve circulation in the legs. By engaging in these practices regularly, you not only support your muscle recovery post-workout but also cultivate a habit that promotes long-term circulation health, helping to keep your legs feeling light and energized! Remember, integrating such mindful practices into your routine can significantly impact your overall well-being, helping to prevent discomfort and enhance the vitality of your lower extremities.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

As my library of animation tutorials has expanded it's been necessary to re-structure and expand the principles into my own list of 21 'Foundations'. Keep using the 12 if it suits you, but as a teaching device I find the 21 to be far more comprehensive.\n\nRead the full essay (link above) for more detail. I'm also going to create individual movies covering each of the 21 foundations, with links to my Lynda/Linkedin-Learning courses, so that a student can focus on each foundation more efficiently.\n\nFollow this link for a free 30 day trial of linkedin-learning:\nhttps://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/1810945/469502/8005\n\n*\n\nEcho by Broken Elegance üé© https://soundcloud.com/brokenelegance\nCreative Commons ‚Äî Attribution 3.0 Unported  ‚Äî CC BY 3.0 \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/_MyowPoOUgk", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 580, "publish_time": "20190115"}

As my library of animation tutorials has expanded it's been necessary to re-structure and expand the principles into my own list of 21 'Foundations'. Keep using the 12 if it suits you, but as a teaching device I find the 21 to be far more comprehensive.\n\nRead the full essay (link above) for more detail.

As Tod Mattox, varsity coach at The Bishop‚Äôs school, explains in this video, the 4-2 can be extremely effective if you have a creative setter and good Slide attackers.\n\nWhy use the 4-2 system rather than the 5-1 or 6-2?\n\nHere are some good reasons:\n\n‚ÄìWith a front-row setter in all 6 rotations, the right back doesn‚Äôt have to worry about coming from the back row to set. This allows that player to focus on defense when the other team is attacking. And since the front-row setter is already in position, he/she will have an easier time getting to the ball and delivering a good set.\n\n‚ÄìIf you have a good back-row attacker who can hit the Bic or another back-row set, you take the congestion out of the middle of the court.\n\n‚ÄìBy featuring the Slide as a primary offensive weapon, you give the opponent‚Äôs defense a big challenge. As Mattox says, defending a good Slide attack is not easy, and if teams are good at it, other attacks open up.\n\nAn easy way to test this system to see if it is a good fit for your team is to run a 6v6 scrimmage with both sides in a 4-2 rotation. Setters are always in the front row and should be opposite each other in the rotation.\n\n In this video, Mattox urges the setters to attack frequently, set the Slide and run the Go, a fast left-side set. (Higher left-side sets are OK, too.)\n\nOutside hitters often get good looks in the 4-2 system because the opponent‚Äôs middle has to wait a split second longer to respect the Slide.\n\nTo increase the chance for success on the Slide, passers should pass more to the middle of the court rather than the right side and the right back should stay a little deeper in transition so he/she doesn‚Äôt clog up the slide hitter‚Äôs approach.\n\nFor a closer look at the 4-2 volleyball offense, check out this video by USA Youth National Team coach Jim Stone.\n\nFor more free videos about volleyball drills, skill training, practice strategies and game management, visit https://www.theartofcoachingvolleyball.com\n\nShop for drill books, coaches handbooks, practice planners and other coaching tools at https://store.theartofcoachingvolleyball.com\n\nSubscribe to The Art of Coaching Volleyball on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjcTnzB1Pv03LCHyysSW36g\n\nFollow The Art of Coaching Volleyball to stay up-to-date on new videos, clinics and more:\n- Facebook: https://buff.ly/3dvBzFJ\n- Twitter: https://buff.ly/2xrwEVE\n- Instagram: https://buff.ly/33Vfw72\n- Pinterest: https://buff.ly/2UrdxUG", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 435, "publish_time": "20220727"}

As Tod Mattox, varsity coach at The Bishop‚Äôs school, explains in this video, the 4-2 can be extremely effective if you have a creative setter and good Slide attackers.\n\nWhy use the 4-2 system rather than the 5-1 or 6-2?\n\nHere are some good reasons:\n\n‚ÄìWith a front-row setter in all 6 rotations, the right back doesn‚Äôt have to worry about coming from the back row to set. This allows that player to focus on defense when the other team is attacking. And since the front-row setter is already in position, he/she will have an easier time getting to the ball and delivering a good set.\n\n‚ÄìIf you have a good back-row attacker who can hit the Bic or another back-row set, you take the congestion out of the middle of the court.\n\n‚ÄìBy featuring the Slide as a primary offensive weapon, you give the opponent‚Äôs defense a big challenge. As Mattox says, defending a good Slide attack is not easy, and if teams are good at it, other attacks open up.\n\nAn easy way to test this system to see if it is a good fit for your team is to run a 6v6 scrimmage with both sides in a 4-2 rotation. Setters are always in the front row and should be opposite each other in the rotation.\n\n In this video, Mattox urges the setters to attack frequently, set the Slide and run the Go, a fast left-side set. (Higher left-side sets are OK, too.)\n\nOutside hitters often get good looks in the 4-2 system because the opponent‚Äôs middle has to wait a split second longer to respect the Slide.\n\nTo increase the chance for success on the Slide, passers should pass more to the middle of the court rather than the right side and the right back should stay a little deeper in transition so he/she doesn‚Äôt clog up the slide hitter‚Äôs approach.\n\nFor a closer look at the 4-2 volleyball offense, check out this video by USA Youth National Team coach Jim Stone.\n\nFor more free videos about volleyball drills, skill training, practice strategies and game management, visit https://www.theartofcoachingvolleyball.com\n\nShop for drill books, coaches handbooks, practice planners and other coaching tools at https://store.theartofcoachingvolleyball.com\n\nSubscribe to The Art of Coaching Volleyball on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjcTnzB1Pv03LCHyysSW36g\n\nFollow The Art of Coaching Volleyball to stay up-to-date on new videos, clinics and more:\n- Facebook: https://buff.ly/3dvBzFJ\n- Twitter: https://buff.ly/2xrwEVE\n- Instagram: https://buff.ly/33Vfw72\n- Pinterest: https://buff.ly/2UrdxUG", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 435, "publish_time": "20220727"}

She's answering common facial-filler questions and performing full-face rejuvenations on two of her clients. Filler is a volume inducer, mostly made out of hyaluronic acid, that helps add volume to areas that are shifting downwards because of aging. Common areas patients request are the eyes, cheeks, and lips. However, fillers can also be placed on the chin, jawline, and around the nose. \n\nClients can see a difference immediately after receiving filler, but fully healed results show in about two weeks. One syringe of filler typically costs about $500 to $1,000, and results can last a year to two years. If someone is doing a full facial lift with fillers, such as a combination of the under eyes, cheeks, lips, nasolabial folds, and jawline, that can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $10,000, and those results can last three to four years. If a client isn't happy with their results, hyaluronic acid fillers can be completely dissolved. It's important to visit a professional who will understand your face shape, ethnicity, mental and physical health concerns, and what to do if a treatment has complications.\n\nFor more, please visit Vanessa Lee:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/vanessalee_rn/\nThe Things We Do:\nhttps://thethingswedo.co/. \n\nMORE BEAUTY INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Medical Pedicures Transform Feet\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHuvDvCkbC0&t=13s\n11 Grossly Satisfying Beauty Treatments For Better Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pdzwgKFHI\nHow A Nonsurgical Face-Lift Works | Beauty Explorers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot_2tuwRR2U\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Fillers #BeautyTransformations #BeautyInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

The desire for community and purpose will always find a way even if it's in the form of a summer work program. It is even more powerful when paired with the poetry of passionate teens.  \n\nDenise Fellows, prior to SummerWorks, referred to herself as a ‚Äúsilent poet.‚Äù She said that her poetry used to ‚Äòscream so loud to be heard by someone other than her own ears.‚Äô Denise worked with SummerWorks in the summer of 2014, and it was there she began sharing her work.\n\nKira Cobbs was born in 1998 in Denver, CO. She plays the piano and practices Chinese and sign language; she also participates in her school‚Äôs poetry organization, Louder Than a Bomb. She has been writing poetry since she was inspired to do so by her fourth grade teacher. Kira participated in SummerWorks in 2014.\n\n\r\nJasmine Johnson is a sophomore at Benson High School and she participated in SummerWorks 2014.‚ÄúWe all became somewhat of a big family,‚Äù Johnson says of her experienced ‚ÄúI never for a second thought I would enjoy cleaning city parks, but if I could work at SummerWorks again I would. It was an amazing experience and opportunity.‚Äù \r\n\r\nJasmine would like to thank her 7th grade teacher, Ms. Carlson of Monroe Middle School, for introducing her to poetry. Jasmine says poetry is the reasons she is the person she is today; it has helped her through anger, depression, and other life struggles.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Although mean levels and area under the curve of testosterone were similar in both groups, fragmented sleep resulted in a significant delay in testosterone rise (03:24 h ¬± 1:13 vs. 22:35 h ¬± 0:22)\nDuring fragmented sleep, nocturnal testosterone rise was observed only in subjects who showed REM episodes (4/10) - findings indicate that the sleep-related rise in serum testosterone levels is linked with the appearance of first REM sleep. The rise in testosterone levels was slower when REM latency was longer in young adult men, testosterone levels begin to rise on falling asleep, peak at about the time of first REM, and remain at the same levels until awakening.\n\nMorning vs Evening Workouts Study - Study - journal PLoS One:\nLooked at the effect of time of day on performance, hormonal and metabolic response during a 1000-M cycling time trial in 9 recreational cyclists, average age 31. The participants performed a 1000-m TT at either 8 am or 6 pm, in randomized, repeated-measures, crossover design a 1000-m cycling time-trial. The time to complete the time trial was lower in the evening than in the morning (88.2 vs 94.7, respectively), but there was no significant different in pacing. However, oxygen uptake and aerobic mechanical power output at 600 and 1000 m tended to be higher in the evening. There was also a main effect of time of day for insulin, cortisol, and total and free testosterone concentration, which were all higher in the morning (+60%, +26%, +31% and +22%, respectively) The norepinephrine response to the exercise was increased in the morning (+46%), and it was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in the response of glucose.\n\nReferences:\n\n1) The Effect of Diurnal Variation on Clinical Measurement of Serum Testosterone and Other Sex Hormone Levels in Men.

They can also help with asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Purchase a high altitude training mask here: https://amzn.to/2VWcevd (affiliate link) NOTE: This is not the unit I used in the video. That one is no longer available.\n\nThese types of breathing exercises can give improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance and exercise performance. \n\nInspiratory muscle training is basically a series of breathing exercises that aim to strengthen the bodies‚Äô respiratory muscles making it easier for people to breathe. When a person is breathing normally, they typically use between 10 to 15 per cent of his or her total lung capacity. However, with Inspiratory muscle training, a person can typically increase the amount of lung capacity used. \n\nA tool that can help with inspiratory muscle training is a high altitude training mask like the one from Perpetual Air featured in the video. These masks restrict air flow and can help with inspiratory muscle training. The Perpetual Air mask has various levels of air restriction that are easily adjusted.\n\nThe following exercises can be done either with our without a high altitude training mask.\n\nThe first breathing exercise is very simple. Breath in through your nose for 2 seconds and breath out through your mouth with pursed lips for 4 seconds. \n\nNow you are going to move your arms with the breathing to loosen up the muscles around your chest area. \n\nFinally, breathing with your diaphragm, or belly breathing, is a great way to relax and improve your breathing.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nBreathing Exercises for Relaxation or COPD:\nhttps://youtu.be/-7-CAFhJn78\n\n===========================================\n\nSUPPORT me on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo\n\n===========================================\n\nBreathing Exercises for COPD, Asthma, Bronchitis & Emphysema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpTNUGwXbTU\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.

Some MCU actors like Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd were far from ripped and muscular when they were cast in their respective roles. However, they put in the work to attain the fit and athletic bodies they sport on screen. This is no easy feat, as getting your body into peak shape is an incredibly difficult task. Sometimes it take‚Äôs over a year of strict dieting and workout plans to achieve their goals. And then years more maintaining this shape for future movies in the MCU. Luckily for them, they are provided with top of the line trainers and dieticians that help them along their journey. This definitely helps, but it‚Äôs still on the actors to apply themselves to the regimes assigned. Which actors had difficulties maintaining their diets?\nSometimes the trainers used by these actors are actually good friends with them, as is the case with Chris Hemsworth, who has known his trainer since he was four years old.\n\nAll those muscles aren‚Äôt just for show, and these actors have done some seriously impressive things.

As we get older, our testosterone tends to naturally decline. We can‚Äôt stop it completely, but we can fight back against the loss of our needed male hormones. Having less fat and more muscle is crucial for our testosterone production. When you think of building muscle, you think of resistance training and lifting weights at the gym or at home. While that is the major key for building muscle, there are some needs you need to fo to help optimize muscle growth.\n\nAside from resistance training, there are 2 more major keys for building muscle faster after 50. Recovery and getting good quality sleep is another crucial part for building muscle. That is the time when your body works on repairing the muscle fibers you damage from your workouts, helping them grow bigger during the recovery. \n\nThe last major component is nutrition. In order to build more muscle, you need to make sure that you are consuming enough protein. Protein is the most needed food group in order to build more muscle during your recovery from your workouts. There are a lot of foods you can eat, supplements you can, protein powder you can drink to get protein in your body. That is why I am going to give you 5 great foods that you can eat to help you build more muscle faster after 50.\n\nHere are the 5 foods to help you build muscle faster after 50.

Or in other words, simply figuring out how you‚Äôre going to group your exercises throughout the week. And although there isn‚Äôt one ‚Äúbest workout split‚Äù for everyone, certain muscle building splits have their advantages. For example, we know that training a muscle at least 2x/week is superior to 1x/week. This automatically makes the common bro split inferior to other higher muscle training frequency workout splits. Training splits like the upper lower split, full body workout splits (‚Äútotal body workouts‚Äù), and the push pull legs workout split train each muscle 2x/week whereas the bro split does not. This not only helps better optimize protein synthesis but also enables you to get more quality sets done since your workout volume is spread out over multiple workouts.\n\nBut which of these splits should you choose for mass? Well, it depends on your training experience. The best workout split for beginners looking to put on mass is likely a 3 day workout split with full body workouts. This is because you can train the compound lifts frequently and master them very quickly without causing too much muscle damage. Then, as you gain experience and need more volume to progress, you can switch to a 4 day workout split (such as the upper/lower split) to help spread out your volume better throughout the week. And then, as you progress even more, switching to a 5 day workout split or a 6 day workout split (push pull legs for example) would be wise to keep your workouts from being excessively long and fatiguing. However, despite what research says, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that workout volume and consistency are the more important factors. So choose the workout split that you enjoy the most and best fits your schedule ‚Äì as that‚Äôs going to be the best option for you! \n\nAnd if you‚Äôre looking for a step-by-step program that shows you how to optimize your training and nutrition in order to progress as efficiently as possible, then simply take my starting-point analysis tool below to find which program is best for you: \nhttps://builtwithscience.com/bws-free-fitness-quiz/gender?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=Video&utm_content=Description%20box&utm_campaign=Science%20based%20back%20split%20to%20maximize%20growth%20Jan%206%2F2019\n\nLINK TO WRITTEN ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/best-workout-split/ \n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM & FACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeremyethier/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Jeremyethierfit/\n\nMUSIC:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\nSTUDIES:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729395\n\nOTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES:\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/frequency-muscle/\nhttps://mennohenselmans.com/optimal-program-design/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 427, "publish_time": "20190106"}

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nThe success of Joker and Venom has completely changed the way movie studios are looking at superhero movies. No longer are our caped heroes standing front and center. With Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad coming soon, we could see a whole slate of super-villain movies hitting the big screen. Why bother trying another stab at remaking the Fantastic Four when there‚Äôs such a better character to focus on instead? Doctor Doom stood in the shadows of both Fantastic Four franchises, serving as the main villain, but not getting fleshed out enough to truly becoming a compelling part of the films. Catwoman had her shot at a solo movie with Halle Berry‚Äôs disappointing cheesefest back in 2004, but there‚Äôs another DC vixen who could really shine with a solo story -- and her name is Poison Ivy. Just the thought of Poison Ivy on the big screen has probably conjured some pretty bad memories of Batman and Robin, but let‚Äôs just pull that withered weed from the garden and start over. Despite the cheesy puns about ice, snow, and everything frozen, you cannot deny the dramatic possibilities of the Mr. Freeze origin story we saw glimpses of in the 1997 disaster Batman & Robin. Arnold Schawnegger‚Äôs portrayal of Mr. Freeze is pretty much a big joke now and has resulted in no other portrayals of the character on the big-screen, but he definitely has a great story to tell. \n\nThe Joker did a deep dive into the character‚Äôs psyche, backstory, and provided a whole new perspective on the madness behind him. But what other villains deserve a similar movie treatment? Between some Marvel juggernauts and DC villains who deserve proper big-screen treatment, let‚Äôs see who should go solo in the future!\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 635, "publish_time": "20191024"}

Initially I was a little apprehensive, worried that my drawing skills might have deteriorated during my time away.\n\nBut as I mention in the video, to my surprise they‚Äôd actually improved! I‚Äôm not sure what the exact reason behind this is, but I suspect that after getting some distance my brain had time to process everything I‚Äôd learned. So when I eventually started drawing again, it was all still there!\n\nI do feel like my work has a bit more rhythm to it now, which feels great. I‚Äôm not thinking about it, or judging it as much anymore. I‚Äôm not too concerned about the small things. The creation process seems to have become quite fluid for me as of recently and I‚Äôm thankful for that.\n\nThe idea for this character design sketch came about after I‚Äôd spent long enough thinking about an idea that had been fermenting inside my mind for the last few months. It was an idea for a comic book, and the more I thought about it, the more complete it became.\n\nEventually I‚Äôd somehow worked out an entire plot in my head without writing anything down at all, and at that point I figured hey, why not put pencil to paper and see if I can‚Äôt come up with a few cool character concepts for this story?\n\nThe character in this video is one of the key players in the plot. He works at a robotics plant where he manufactures bio mechanical replacement bodies for people to transfer their consciousness to when their organic bodies become obsolete. \n\nThe catch is that these body replacements, otherwise known as capsules, are reserved only for the wealthy and the powerful. \nSo of course this character, being a mere engineer at a manufacturing plant would never be able get his hands on one of these bio mechanical bodies, which is unfortunate for him because it just so happens that his younger brother is terminally ill with a rare disease that can‚Äôt be cured. \n\nHowever, he loves his brother and would do anything to save him ‚Äì so he does the unthinkable, illegally uploading his brothers consciousness into a capsule which does not belong to him.\n\nIn fact, this capsule has been set aside and belongs to one of the most powerful and feared gangsters in the entire city. And that‚Äôs just the beginning of the story! But I‚Äôll leave it there for now. I don‚Äôt want to give away too much just yet ‚Äì especially because I have no idea when I‚Äôll get round to actually putting this comic together!\n\nI hope you enjoy the video! \n\nThanks for watching! \n-Clayton\n\nSoftware Used: Manga Studio\n\nIf you like the video, show your support by commenting, sharing or subscribing. \n\nComic Art Community - https://www.howtodrawcomics.net/comic-art-community/\nHow to Draw Comics .NET - http://www.howtodrawcomics.net/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/howtodrawcomics/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/howtodrawcomics\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/howtodrawcomics\nTumblr - http://howtodrawcomics.tumblr.com/\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/howtodrawcomics/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1271, "publish_time": "20190409"}

Strangely satisfying", "description": "Chill out for 10 mins and let us do the work.\n\nI use timelapse filming mainly to prove to myself that at the end of the day I have actually done some work! Most of these shots cover several hours of digging condensed into just a matter of seconds- but when you're in the woods digging, especially if you're alone, progress can seem painfully slow sometimes! Making a big landing takes so much effort, the volume of dirt alone can mean hundreds, maybe thousands of wheelbarrows to fill, move and empty. \n\nI find that filming a timelapse stops me from getting lazy - if I stop digging to call or message someone it looks very obvious in the shot. You have to keep busy and keep moving. It's a good way of making sure you don't stop until the job is done. I generally set myself a target of something to achieve and then don't go home until it's done- even if it means getting lights out of my car and digging into the night. \n\nThis video is a mash-up of some of the timelapses I have shot over the last few years either of me alone (cheeky week day visits) or with the crew all digging together on Sunday. Even tho we're hopefully nearing the point when we can all return to our local trail spots- it's been weeks since I have ridden or done any digging. I plan to ease myself back into things and spend more time on a shovel than a bike for a while. \n\nReally hope you enjoy the video... Next week's video is a little different from the norm so look out for that one!\n\nTake it easy - oh yeah and subscribe ;-)", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 545, "publish_time": "20200515"}

They were originally used as bull bating dogs, however their will to fight wasn‚Äôt enough for the ring and they later became known as butchers helpers and controlled slaughterhouse cattle in Germany. \n\nBoxers are a HIGH ENERGY DOG!\n\nThe Boxer dogs are a large breed in the ‚ÄúWorking dog breed group‚Äù and weight 50 to 80 lbs. They were first used as police dogs in America and later became more popular to use as family guard dogs since they are intimidating but have a reputation of being friendly and good with kids unlike other mastiff and bully breeds. Another factor that made them unfit for police work is their brachecephalic or squished face causing them to have difficulty breathing in heat or working for long periods of time. They need a cool environment or an AC house to be comfortable. \n\nThe boxer dog has a distinct square strong build and chiseled elegant head. They come in 2 show colors which are the Classic Fawn and Brindle boxers which can have sparse white markings that appear on the face where white may replace part of the otherwise essential black mask and may extend in an upward path between the eyes, but it must not be excessive so as to distract from the true boxer expression.\n\n Boxers however do come in a wide variety of other colors that are not show quality such as seal brindle, reverse brindle, flashy brindle with more white, and mis-marked or party colored.\n\nBoxer dogs are usually super friendly, happy go lucky dogs that love giving kisses, however they  are not clean dogs. They do have a sleek short hair coat that does shed excessively. They also have floopy lips that slobber a lot! You may come across a few that slobber less than others but it‚Äôs a gamble who will slobber more when getting a puppy! Just expect them all to give lots of Slobbery kisses if you get one! \n\nAs for barking, your boxer dog is not an excessive barker and should only bark if there is an intruder around. \n\nOver all, Boxers are very affectionate and smart dogs that love companionship and cuddles on the cough. They are a needy large breed dog that is not independent. They are easy to train and most people who have boxer dogs absolutely love them! \n\nTheir lifespan is 8 to 10 years and they do have a list of health issues, which I‚Äôve made another video about on my channel!  \n\nAlright guys! I hope you loved this video on Boxer dogs! \nDR. LINDSAY BUTZER", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 326, "publish_time": "20230205"}

Accompanied by Ruth O'Brien on vocals, Cher challenged herself in this piece to push her own physical limits as a performer. \nCher started her professional career as a performer at age 17 in her hometown, Los Angeles. Her performances included, singing, dancing, acrobatics and acting¬†at local theme parks and other venues.¬†For a number of years she was the resident Cat Woman amd Wonder Woman, and performed in a variety of live stunt shows where she was ‚Äúgetting paid to run around and¬†beat¬†up¬†boys‚Äù. The thrill of superheros subsequently led to Cher‚Äôs career as a stuntwoman for TV/Film. She then spent a few years in Yosemite National Park, studying yoga, rock climbing &amp; playing on her trapeze, until an opportunity arose to work in Australia, in her trade of graphic design.¬†She has since relocated to Canberra and has immersed herself in the aerial arts as well as various performance projects within the Canberra community. Cher opened Aerial Sports in late 2015, where she has been teaching aerial acrobatics classes and managing the studio. She prefers to be hanging out on an apparatus &amp; sharing her passion for aerial arts¬†as much as possible. Cher is also the co-founder of Solco Acro, Canberra‚Äôs first women‚Äôs aerial acrobatics and dance troupe. Cher Albrecht has been performing professionally since she was 17. She‚Äòs been a TV stuntwoman, and resident Catwoman and Wonder Woman in her hometown of LA. Since moving to Canberra, she‚Äôs immersed herself in various community performance projects.

We are going to talk about composition in painting and learn a few techniques.\n\nColors used: Yellow Ochre, Olive Green, Quinacridone Sienna, Burnt Sienna, Cobalt Blue, Ultramarine Blue, Alizarin Crimson.\n\nPaint: I use a variety of watercolor paint brands (Daniel Smith, Holbein, M.Graham, Nevskaya Palitra). \n\nPaper: Arches, rough texture. You may use any brand you like but, most importantly for this technique, use 100% cotton. \n\nBrushes: I use a variety of brushes by different brands: Silver Brush, Chinese calligraphy brushes from Blue Heron Art and Michael Solovyev, squirrel brushes by Roubleff, synthetic by Escoda and Etchr, Aliexpress, and a few other different brands.

After completing a two-year journey in our Airstream to see all 50 states and 51 National Parks, we left to travel abroad. We have downsized our possessions and sold our home so that we can wander about with only the things in our backpacks. \n\nWe love living on the road, traveling each week to a new location. We plan to travel extensively to every part of the world. Ours is not a slow travel lifestyle but rather a vagabondish one. The goal is not to check a country off a list, but to experience it by meeting new people, seeing how others live, and making new friends. We believe in laughing, loving, and living our lives to the fullest. \n\nWe are working hard to build a beautiful website where you can get travel information about the places we have been. In addition, we post blog articles to help you travel better. Our channel is a way of augmenting that effort, so sometimes we post videos about how to travel or a vlog showing our lives on the road as we do an activity or an adventure. We also post Shorts, so check those out, too.

This is just the spot to cool off after a day on the beach. Laze around the pool, or move to the shaded deck upstairs and enjoy burgers fresh off the grill seated at the covered dining area. You can even watch your favorite sports channel on the outdoor TV.\n\nBe sure to turn the lights on around the pool at night and see how beautiful it is .\n\nThere are child protective gates on both levels of the house, so young children will not be able to access the pool area without an adult opening the gate.\n\nJumping and diving are not permitted and there should always be adult supervision when there are children in the pool.\n\nWhen the kids get tired of swimming in the pool they can move to the garage and play ping pong and fuss ball. You can open the garage door and then lower a screened door to allow for ventilation. And just in case the kids work up a thirst there is a small refrigerator there also. This is handy for the pool area too, so you don't have to go back to the house for cold drinks.\n\nThe outdoor shower with hot and cold water is just outside the garage - perfect for getting all the sand off before hitting the pool!\n\nThe kitchen is super well stocked and has everything you will need to prepare meals for your group. It has a breakfast bar with additional seating just in case there is not enough room for everyone round the dining table.\n\nThe 3 bedrooms consist of a king in the master bedroom with TV, large walk in closet and en suite bathroom.\n\nThe second bedroom has a queen bed and TV and the third bedroom is ideal for kids with a bunk bed with a single on top and a double below - and then there is even another bed that pulls out. The kids will love it! And they also have their own TV!\n\nThe den downstairs is comfy and cozy with an electric fireplace, 65 inch TV, games for the kids and there is also a queen sleeper sofa for those extra guests.\n\nThe third bathroom and laundry is also on this level and is convenient to the pool - no need to go all the way upstairs.\n\nOf course the house has ceiling fans in all rooms, wifi, pool toys and chairs for the beach with a buggy to transport them over. It literally takes about 3 minutes to walk from the house to the closest beach access - it is really no distance at all.\n\nThe house is dog friendly for most breeds with a 40 pound limit on size. You will have to show proof of vet prescribed flea medication and provide covers to protect furniture and bedding from pet hair.\n\nThree grocery stores are near by and the historic downtown is about 10 minutes by car, so the situation is ideal and this house really offers everything possible to make this your best vacation ever!", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 303, "publish_time": "20190627"}

This inside guide to Apulia shows you the most gorgeous, perfect turquoise water beaches from Polignano a Mare south. For the best places in Puglia, we look between Bari and Brindisi to find the best places: beaches along the Adriatic or Eastern coast of Puglia, Italy. Paradise!\n\nUNICEF awarded 2022 Blue Flags to all the prettiest beaches in this Puglia travel guide video. A blue flag means that the water, shore and facilities are clean and environmentally friendly and offer public access. You can learn more about the nicest beaches of Blue Flag here. https://www.blueflag.global Gobs of blue flag beaches lie along the turquoise coast of Apulia and the Bari coast.\n\nThe best, most epic beaches to visit in Puglia Italy featured in this Puglia travel guide video in order of appearance: \nPolignano a Mare. Lama Monachile and San Vito. Most dramatic setting beaches.\nMonopoli. Cala Porta Vecchia, Cala Cozze, Porto Bianco, Porto Porto Rosso, and Cala Paradiso. Some of the prettiest beaches in Italy. Rock diving. Stand in the deep water on a sand bar.\nCapitolo. We liked the water in front of Bambu Club. Longest stretch of golden sand beaches.\nNear Ostuni. Pilone and Lido Morelli, Torre Guaceto, a nature preserve with a turtle rescue center, Torre Pozzelle. Most natural beach and least crowded beach!\nSanto Stefano Castle. Porto Ghiacciolo. Lido Santo Stefano. Most beautiful, cleanest, soft white sand. Best of all! Our favorite beach in Italy so far.\n\nPuglia travel guide tip! How to unlock Puglia‚Äôs best kept secret? Here‚Äôs the trick to public access to the shallow end of the bay at Lido Santo Stefano. Turn off the main road and come through the stone pillars toward the castle. Where the road is roped off to the castle, turn right, pass the parking lot entrance to the private club, 50 meters later park outside the campground. \n\nAt the metal barrier through the pedestrian turnstile to the left just before the campground entrance. Here‚Äôs a video that shows more of the turnstile than we captured. https://youtu.be/LExdEF5tmF4\n\nAfter the turnstile the dirt road takes you to the peninsula. Follow the footpath along the bay and the cliff toward the beach club to the boat ramp where you can set up your towels. We don‚Äôt recommend the slippery rocks, though we did see plenty of other people going in the water.

But it‚Äôs challenging to know which upgrades are worth the investment and which are a waste of time and money.\n\nHere are a few home improvement projects to consider that are almost certain to improve your resale value and the look of your home.\n\n1. Minor Kitchen Remodel\nKitchens in older homes weren‚Äôt designed to be as functional as they are today. If you‚Äôre still cooking in a kitchen that pre-dates your birth, a minor kitchen remodel might be just the thing to make you love the culinary arts again, all while increasing the value of your home.\n\nUpgrade your appliances with energy-efficient models, replace outdated cabinets with newer options, and redo your counters. The average return on investment for a minor kitchen remodel is 81 percent, with the average cost of the project coming in at around $21,000.\n\nAlways over-budget for your project. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you decide to replace or upgrade‚Äîremodeling projects will pretty much never cost less than you anticipate. You can make choices to save money, but in the end, you will almost always end up spending as much or more than you expected.\n\n2. Wooden Deck Installation\n\nAdding a deck to the back of your home gives you a great place to throw a barbecue, host an outdoor dinner, or even install a hot tub so you can enjoy the outdoors without getting dirt on your feet. It is also a great way to add value to your home, as long as you choose a design made of wood instead of one made of plastic or composite. A wooden deck will cost you an average of $10,500 to build, but most homeowners recoup 85.4 percent of that cost‚Äîone of the largest returns on investment that you‚Äôll find on this list.\n\nIf you do choose wood, make sure that you‚Äôre ready to sand and refinish it periodically to ensure that you can enjoy your deck without worrying about you or your guests getting splinters.\n\n3. Garage Door Replacement\nWhen was the last time you replaced your garage door? An old or out-of-date garage door doesn‚Äôt just damage your home‚Äôs value‚Äîit can be downright dangerous. While they were made safer in 1993 when a law was passed mandating that all garage doors be equipped with an auto-reversing feature, they‚Äôre still the biggest and heaviest moving object in your home.\n\nOn average, you‚Äôll spend around $3,600 to replace your garage door and all the associated equipment, but you‚Äôll reclaim nearly all of that in value for your property. The ROI for a garage door replacement is an astonishing 97.5 percent, in addition to making your home safer while improving the property‚Äôs value and curb appeal‚Äîall in one neat package.\n\nKeep reading the article \"The 5 Best Home Improvements to Add Resale Value\" here:\nhttps://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/5-home-improvements-improve-resale\n\nSubscribe to the BiggerPockets Channel for the best real estate investing education online!\n\nBecome a member of the BiggerPockets community of real estate investors - https://www.biggerpockets.com", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 369, "publish_time": "20201209"}

Today, we're going to delve into the fascinating life of Mansa Musa, Mansa Musa was the wealthiest person in history, and we're going to find out how he got there.\nMansa Musa was the ruler of the Mali Empire, located in what is now West Africa. But he wasn't just any ruler. He was the kind of guy who had so much gold that he made Scrooge McDuck look like a penny-pincher. And we're not talking about a few gold coins here and there. We're talking about so much gold that he caused inflation wherever he went. That's right, folks. Mansa Musa was the OG influencer. He could walk into a market and throw around so much cash that the price of goods would skyrocket for months afterward.\n\nBut Mansa Musa wasn't just about showing off his bling. He was also a devout Muslim and made a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324. And when I say pilgrimage, I mean the kind of pilgrimage that puts a European backpacking trip to shame. He travelled with a caravan of thousands of people, including soldiers, scholars, and slaves. And he didn't just travel light. He brought so much gold with him that he had to hire a team of camels just to carry it all. Can you imagine being that rich? \"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't come to your party tonight. I have to go hire some camels to carry my gold.\"\nBut Mansa Musa wasn't all about showing off his wealth. He was also a patron of Islam and built numerous mosques and madrasas, or Islamic schools. He was a true leader, both in his empire and in the wider Islamic world.\nSo, get ready to take a journey back in time to the days of camels, gold, and Islamic scholarship. Mansa Musa's story is one for the books, and we're about to uncover all the juicy details.\n\nMansa Musa was born into a wealthy family in the year 1280. His father was the ruler of the Mali Empire, which at the time was one of the wealthiest and most powerful empires in West Africa. Mansa Musa was not the firstborn son, but his intelligence and charm quickly made him a favourite of his father and the people of the empire.\n\nAs a child, Mansa Musa was educated in the ways of Islam and was trained in subjects such as law, history, and administration. He was a quick learner and showed a great deal of promise from an early age. However, his path to the throne was not without its challenges.\n\nWhen Mansa Musa's father died in 1312, the empire was in a state of turmoil. There were several contenders for the throne, and it was not immediately clear who would succeed the previous ruler. Mansa Musa's older brother was initially chosen to be the next ruler, but he proved to be an ineffective leader and was eventually overthrown by Mansa Musa himself.\nNow, let's be real. Overthrowing your own brother to become ruler of an empire is not exactly the most honourable thing to do. But in Mansa Musa's defence, he did it with style. He gathered a group of loyal followers and staged a successful coup, declaring himself the new ruler of the Mali Empire. It's like something out of Game of Thrones, only with less incest and more gold.\n\nAs soon as he took the throne, Mansa Musa set about consolidating his power and expanding the empire's territory. He was a savvy leader and quickly realized that the key to success was controlling the empire's vast resources, particularly its gold mines. He also developed a strong military and established trade relationships with neighbouring kingdoms.\n\nWelcome to Black Journals, a channel dedicated to exploring and sharing the rich history, literature, and culture of the African American community.

This island is located inside Disney World, and it's still standing today. There's nothing left but ruins and sad memories, but it's definitely still inside of the Disney World Park in Orlando, Florida.\n\n9: The Rainbow Tunnel\nIt may seem completely silly and ridiculous in 2020, but between 1982 and 1992, guests at Disney World absolutely loved the Rainbow Tunnel. It was an exciting journey into the imagination, located inside the ImageWorks glass pyramid.\n\n8: River Country\nBelieve it or not, there is an entire theme park hidden at Walt Disney World that has been rotting and decaying for around two decades. It was once known as River Country, and it's one of the secrets Disney does not want you to know about.\n\n7: Wonders of Life\nSome people say the Wonders of Life attraction was the least fun place to go in the history of Epcot. The building once housed all kinds of bizarre rides. Well, some people wouldn't even really call them rides. \n\n6: Nara Dreamland\nNara Dreamland is not technically part of any Disney operation. And in fact, there is a real Disneyland in Japan, just a few hours away in Tokyo. But there's no doubt that the creators of Nara Dreamland, located near the busy port city of Osaka, was based on the famous Disneyland park in California.\n\n5: The Singing Runway\nThe Singing Runway was once an airport designed specifically for Disney World in Orlando. There has not been another runway since its closure in 1972, but it apparently still sings if you drive fast enough along it.\n\n4: The Mark Twain Boat\nAt Disneyland Paris, the Mark Twain riverboat has been abandoned. It's currently floating sadly in the Frontierland‚Äôs Rivers of the Far West. Not only is the boat completely abandoned, but it is in terrible shape.\n\n3: Food Rocks\nFood Rocks was perhaps the strangest attraction ever designed at Epcot. It featured singing food ‚Äì and that's pretty much it. Food would sing the message of healthy eating to anyone bored enough to stop and listen. \n\n2: The People Mover\nThe People Mover was one of Walt Disney's last ideas. It was his premier idea for Epcot before it opened. And if you've ever wondered what Epcot stands for, it's the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. \n\n1: Beastly Kingdom\nBeastly Kingdom is not actually an abandoned park. It was once an idea for a bizarre Disney attraction ‚Äì but it never came to life. You may be familiar with Animal Kingdom, but the truth of the original concept is far stranger than you could ever imagine. \n\n#abandonedparks #disneypark #abandoneddisney #americaneye", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 795, "publish_time": "20210205"}

Furthermore, nearly 80% of those individuals who suffer a sprain are likely to experience re-injury.\n\nA number of studies have demonstrated the positive effects of exercise for treating ankle sprains, but researchers have questioned how the addition of manual therapy might influence outcomes.\n\nIn 2013, Cleland and colleagues demonstrated that those put in a manual therapy (joint mobilizations) plus exercise group did better in terms of pain and function than those in an exercise-only group at 4 weeks and 6 months.\n\nThere is a lot of hate out there right now for manual therapy, and while I realize exercise has the best evidence, ankle sprains may be one issue where seeing a physio for a combination of skilled manual care and exercise guidance would be wise.\n\nReferences: \n\n1.

This video provides information about the cerebellum connection.  All balancing exercises in this video are inspired by the book ADHD 2.0 by Edward Hallowell and John Ratey.  The balancing exercises in this video target the cerebellum and the vestibular system of the inner ear. These two areas combined are referred to as the vestibulo cerebellar system.  Compelling evidence from research citings in this book suggest that strengthening this system not only improves physical skill but also attention and focus and emotional regulation. Chapter three of this book goes into detail regarding the cerebellum connection. What interested me the most about this connection is the affect of calming emotions.  I've personally tried balancing exercises with children who struggle with emotional dysregulation and I've seen first had how the balancing is used as a \"bottom up\" regulation tool that younger children can access to help bring balance to an emotionally hijacked brain. Since their frontal lobes are so underdeveloped (the frontal lobes are used for \"top down\" regulation techniques), this is an exciting intervention for them to experience.  The book introduces the concept of stimulating the cerebellum through balance to regulate emotions and increase focus and attention. Since reading ADHD 2.0 I have introduced all the children and teens I work with to balancing exercises and I made this video for them to practice over the summer and outside of school hours.  This is just an introduction to some of the most popular balancing activities.  I've also incorporated some Bal-a-Vis-X with the two small rubber balls and the cross body movements.  \n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nThe balance board can be found on Amazon.\n\nBook: ADHD 2.0  (found on Amazon and other book sellers).\n\nThe book mentions a program called Zing Performance.  Some of the movements in this video were found from Zing videos.  https://www.zingperformance.com/\n\nCrossing the midline research: \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7754478/\n\n40 midline crossings you can do at home: \nhttps://otperspective.com/40-crossing-midline-activities-you-can-do-at-home/\n\nHere is more about Bal-A-Vis-X:\nhttps://www.bal-a-vis-x.com/\n\nRubber balls and bean bags:\nhttps://bavxresources.com/ \n\nDisclaimer:  I am licensed to practice psychotherapy in the state of California.

Because while a lot of us are familiar with some of the more obvious effects in terms of our cardiovascular health and general fitness, there are some incredible, lesser-known benefits that make aerobic exercise an essential component of our overall health and wellness.\n\nAnd to give you some additional support in terms of incorporating more aerobic exercise into your routine this week, I‚Äôm also going to give you some quick and simple tips on routines and activities you can do to get started. Particularly ones that are very time efficient and effective.\n\nThe Top Health Benefits of Aerobic Exercise (0:44)\n\n#1 Helps Build a Stronger Immune System\n\nMost guys don‚Äôt know that consistent aerobic exercise is research-proven to keep your immune system strong and help your body ward off common illnesses like the flu or a cold.\n\n#2 Great Way to Burn Fat\n\nAerobics also increase your fat-burning capacity ‚Äì long after you‚Äôre done exercising: By regularly doing aerobic exercise, your muscles develop a higher number of mitochondria, which help you burn more fat at rest ‚Äì even when you‚Äôre not exercising.\n\n#3 Correlated with a Longer Lifespan\n\nAerobics help you live longer: According to the newest scientific research, those who engage in aerobic exercise live longer than those who do not.\n\n#4 Helps Improve Your Brain Function\n\nAerobics makes you smarter: New research also shows that aerobics increases your brain‚Äôs production of a molecule called Irisin that improves memory and protects our brains against degeneration.\n\n#5 Improves Cardiovascular Health\n\nAerobics makes your heart stronger: Aerobics train your heart to beat more efficiently, so your heart doesn‚Äôt have to work as hard. \n\nThat‚Äôs why aerobically fit people have lower heart rates than non-fit people. In fact, elite athletes often have resting heart rates as low as 40 beats per minute (the average man over 40 is 90bpm).\n\n#6 Decreases Chance of Disease\n\nAerobics ward off most major health risks: Studies also show that aerobics helps reduce your risk of diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure.\n\nHow to Get Started With Aerobic Exercise (4:20)\n\nNow, after understanding these top benefits of aerobic exercise, it‚Äôs also important to look at the best practice for aerobic exercise. Because for those of us with busy schedules, it can be pretty difficult to fit in an hour or two each day of light jogging or running on the treadmill to get these benefits. But thankfully, as you‚Äôll discover in this video, there is a much more time-efficient way to get started with aerobic exercise and still see the amazing effects.\n\n#1 Daily Walking\n#2 Regular Cardio\n#3 Strength & Cardio Circuit Training\n\nSo I hope this guide leaves you with some added motivation to incorporate more aerobic exercise into your routine, and some simple ideas on how to get started. Because once you do, I think you‚Äôll find that aerobic exercise is an essential part of creating the healthy lifestyle you‚Äôre working towards, and it doesn‚Äôt have to eat up a ton of time to make it happen.\n\nIf you feel your lifestyle could use an improvement, then check out our FF30X 30-Day Transformation Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-ff30x-program\nIf you want to start putting on muscle TODAY, check out our Fit Father Old School Muscle Building Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-osm-program\n\nYour friends here at the FFP, \n\n-Dr. Balduzzi + The Men's Health Experts @ The Fit Father Project\n\n**Disclaimer: This information is for reference purposes ONLY and cannot replace personal information you can and should discuss with your Doctor.

You can select the dryness or wetness of the brush and there is a 3D brush tip which simulates a real brush pen.  Zen Brush 3 now allows you to blend different strokes and colors and even wet the paper to allow the ink to realistically bleed together. This is a great way to practice writing Kanji or Chinese Characters!\nThe app works best with the apple pencil but you can also just use your finger to paint or write characters.\nËøô‰∏™Á°¨‰ª∂ÊòØÊàëÊâæÂà∞ÁöÑÊúÄÂ•ΩÁöÑÁîµÂ≠êÊØõ„ÄÇ ÊàëÁî®ÂÆÉËÅîÁ≥ªÂÜôÂ≠ó„ÄÇÂ≠¶‰∏≠ÊñáÊàñÊó•ÊñáÁöÑÊúãÂèã‰∏ÄÂÆö‰ºöÂñúÊ¨¢ÔºÅ\nhttps://www.mclartyfilms.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mclartyfilms", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 301, "publish_time": "20210108"}

Competitions kick up the anxiety and the nerves like almost nothing else does. Not to mention we're all a little different. \n\nWhen I was younger and newer to Brazilian Jiu-jitsu I would compete and I always felt like i underperformed. I would watch my matches and in most cases I felt like I was better than what I displayed on the mat. \n\nAs I'll share in the video. Many times I was too concerned with everything else, other than how I planned to win. I would be afraid of letting people down, afraid of the other Brazilian Jiujitsu competitors and just focused on all the wrong things. When I would compete with this mindset I would be so nervous to pull the trigger and go for my techniques. \n\nSo what is a good mindset for BJJ competitions or what's the best mindset for BJJ competitions? \n\nAgain, we are all a little different so the idea of \"best\" is different for everyone in Brazilian Jiu jitsu.\n\nBut in this video I share what mindset has worked best for me and helped me reach more success as a Brazilian Jiu-jitsu Black Belt than I experienced at any other belt. The mindset involves focusing more on yourself, your abilities and how you plan to win. \n\nThis has helped me reach a much more focused and efficient state of mind when it comes to competing in BJJ.\n\nThanks again to Max for the question.

What can we do?\n\nTEACHERS: Get your students in the discussion on KQED Learn, a safe place for middle and high school students to investigate controversial topics and share their voices. https://learn.kqed.org/topics/\n\nThe same chemicals in sunscreen that protect our skin from harmful UV rays are also contributing to the demise of coral reefs around the world.  If we want to save coral but also protect our skin from the sun, what can we do?\n\nABOVE THE NOISE is a show that cuts through the hype and investigates the research behind controversial and trending topics in the news. Hosted by Myles Bess.\n\n*NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY*\n\nSUBSCRIBE by clicking the RED BUTTON above.\nFollow us on Instagram @kqedabovethenoise\n\nCoral reefs are not only beautiful, they are an important part of our oceans‚Äô ecosystems and support a diverse group of marine life. Some estimates suggest that 90% of the world‚Äôs coral is under threat of dying by 2050.  Certain chemicals in sunscreen aren‚Äôt the only reason coral reefs are dying. The situation is actually quite complicated. Climate change, overfishing, and ocean acidification are also all playing a role. \n\nHowever, the chemicals in sunscreen are considered harmful enough to these ecosystems that Hawaii is trying to ban the use of sunscreens with these reef-killing components in them. Now, they aren‚Äôt alone. The Center for Biological diversity has petitioned the federal government to ban the same chemicals across the country. So now the question remains, how can we protect our skin and coral reefs?\n\nHow does sunscreen harm coral?\n\nA major study found that the chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate, which is present in many the common sunscreens we use, is changing the DNA of coral cells so that mature coral becomes sterile and unable to reproduce while younger ones trap themselves in their own skeletons, where they starve and and die.\n\nWhat about coral bleaching?\n\nOxybenzone also exacerbate the problem of coral bleaching because it causes the coral to absorb more heat. Coral bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise to around 87 or 88 degrees Fahrenheit, causing coral to expel the algae called zooxanthellae, which is what gives coral their vibrant colors. \n\nAre all sunscreens bad?\n\nNo, there are quite a few options that are totally safe for you and the environment. For example, sunscreens with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are good options. And, of course, there‚Äôs always the option to stay covered up with clothes or in the shade. \n\nFOR EDUCATORS\n\nWant to bring Above the Noise into the classroom?

The majority of society may not always see it but minority groups experience it on a daily bias.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nALVIN HALL :\nAlvin Hall is an internationally renowned financial educator, television and radio broadcaster, bestselling author, and regular contributor to magazines, newspapers, and websites.\nFor five years on the BBC, he hosted the highly rated and award-winning series, ‚ÄúYour Money or Your Life,‚Äù on which he offered both practical financial and psychological advice to people about how to take control of and fix their financial problems. His radio program, Jay-Z: From Brooklyn to the Boardroom, won the Wincott Foundation Press and Broadcasting Award for the best radio program for 2006. Hall has also hosted programs on current events and contemporary art for BBC Radio 4 including After Katrina and most recently, Alvin Hall‚Äôs Generations of Money. An eight-part television series for BBC World News called Alvin‚Äôs Guide to Good Business was broadcast internationally in 2010. In the US, he is a regular contributor on personal finance and the economy on NPR‚Äôs Tell Me More with Michel Martin.\nAmong Hall‚Äôs bestselling books are: You and Your Money: It‚Äôs More than Just the Numbers, Your Money or Your Life (winner of the WHSmith 2003 People‚Äôs Choice Award), What Not to Spend, Getting Started in Mutual Funds 2nd Edition, and Getting Started in Stocks 3rd Edition. His children‚Äôs book, Show Me the Money, has been published in over 20 foreign-language editions. In the US, the book has been named a Best Children‚Äôs Book of the Year (2009) by the Bank St. Book Committee, which is run by the Bank Street College of Education. It was also named a Notable Social Studies Trade Book for Young People (2009) by a joint project of the National Book Council for Social Studies and the Children‚Äôs Book Council.\nHall lives in New York City where he designs and teaches classes about the investment markets for financial services companies, banks, regulatory authorities, as well as information and technology vendors. His acclaimed classroom programs and speaking engagements have provided thousands of people with a solid grounding in such topics as the workings of financial markets, investment products, effective investment strategies, reducing debt, planning for retirement and personal financial management. Alvin Hall is a member of the NYSE Euronext Financial Literacy Advisory Committee to help develop programs to improve knowledge about all aspects of personal finance among the general public. He is also on the Acquisitions Committee of the Studio Museum in Harlem.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTRANSCRIPT:\nAlvin Hall: Many people think that as you rise through the ranks and become successful and you start earning money‚Äîas an African American‚Äîthat all of this prejudiced interaction goes away, that it doesn‚Äôt exist.\nBut you can walk into a building and a guard in a building, because of the way you look, the way you‚Äôre dressed decides he or she is going to put you in your place. They‚Äôre going to show you who has the power here.\nSo when that happens you have a whole different dynamic that you have to deal with. And I can tell you from experience that when this happens to you, other white people around you don‚Äôt see it. They just don‚Äôt see it. But you can tell by the tone of voice, the way they delay dealing with you, all of these subtle things tell you what‚Äôs going on, and then you have to find a way, if this is a place you come to repeatedly, to adjust. But the major thing I tell everyone is that you have to get this out of your soul before you go home because you can‚Äôt take this type of anger into your house, because it sits there, it festers, and that anger becomes more undermining long term. Because eventually you‚Äôre going to walk into a building and somebody‚Äôs going to do that to you, and you‚Äôre not going to be able to handle it, you‚Äôre going to lose your temper.\nToday I feel that if you live in a big urban area you can basically have whatever identity you want, because people will at least not (in general) attack you, yell at you, call you names. That does happen, but you can go through a whole day, maybe a whole week without that happening.\nWhen I was growing up I was lucky if I could get through a day not being reminded in a pejorative way that I was black, tha...\nFor the full transcript, check out https://bigthink.com/videos/alvin-hall-the-quiet-battle-inside-how-to-conquer-discrimination-at-work", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 399, "publish_time": "20180626"}

The respiratory system's main job is to move fresh air into your body while removing waste gases.\n\nWhy are lungs important?\nEvery cell in your body needs oxygen in order to live. The air we breathe contains oxygen and other gases. Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body. At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide. Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where it is removed from the bloodstream and then exhaled. Your lungs and respiratory system automatically perform this vital process, called gas exchange.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

Johnson says: \"It has been over 3 years since the Senate passed a budget.  Think about that.  Even though families and most businesses produce budgets to help control their finances, the largest financial entity in the world is operating without one. Why?  Because Democrats in the Senate refuse to be held accountable.  They either don't have a plan, or they simply do not want their fingerprints on one.\"\n\nHe adds: \"For his part, President Obama has done nothing to encourage the Senate to pass a budget.  Just this week in the Senate, the President's budget lost by a vote of 0 - 99.  Last month, it failed in the House by a vote of 0 -- 414.  And last year, his budget lost 0 - 97 in the Senate.  This is a stunning repudiation of his leadership.\"\n\nHe concludes: \"We can do better than this.  America should do better. It is time to return to the values and principles that made this country great.  I grew up in an America that valued hard work and celebrated success.  America became the economic engine of the world, not because of government, but because millions of Americans had the freedom to pursue their dreams. We can reclaim this heritage once again and build a society where hard work is rewarded and every American has the opportunity to succeed.

I was inspired by Chris Dunn for that particular technique, he has a few instagram videos showing how he does it. \n\nIf you have any questions please ask in the comments. \n\n‚ú• The Quote I reference/butcher: \nGod has loved us without being loved, but we love Him because we are loved. We cannot be of\nany profit to Him, nor love Him with this first love. Yet God demands of us, that as He has loved us without any second thoughts, so He should be loved by us. In what way can we do this, then, since He demands it of us and we cannot give it to Him? I tell you: through a means which He has established by which we can love Him freely, and without the least regard to any profit of ours: we can be useful, not to Him, which is impossible, but to our neighbour...To show the love we have to Him, we ought to serve and love every rational creature...Every virtue receives life from love, and love is gained in love, that is, by raising the eye of our mind to behold how much we are beloved of God. Seeing ourselves loved, we cannot do otherwise than love...So thou seest that we conceive virtues through God and bring them to the birth for our neighbour.\n-- Saint Catherine of Sienna", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 788, "publish_time": "20240619"}

The secret to blending acrylics is to use acrylic retarder to prevent the paint from drying out too soon. I prefer to use Golden OPEN acrylics because the retarder is already mixed into the paint.\n\nI usually blend acrylics after I apply the colors to the canvas. Another tip is to blend the paint with a soft brush. \n\nI also demonstrate how to create soft edges with acrylics. Soft edges have a blurry, out of focus appearance to them. The soft edges make the hard edges stand out more. This is a way to guide the viewers eye to the focal point.\n\nJudging the colors while placing them on a white canvas can be tricky. I find that I have to adjust the values as the painting progresses.\n\nART SUPPLIES & TOOLS USED IN THIS VIDEO\nAll of the links that lead to Blick Art Materials or Amazon are affiliate links. This means that if you click on a link and make a purchase, I earn a commission at no cost to you.\n\nGOLDEN OPEN ACRYLICS\nI used Golden OPEN acrylics for this painting. They're convenient because the retarder is already in the paint, in the proper proportions. The link below contains sets of small tubes of OPEN acrylics so you can try them out, or you can buy the standard sized tubes of individual colors.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5m9\n\nTHE COLORS I USED IN THIS PAINTING\nTitanium White \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcp\nAmazon https://amzn.to/334LyRp\n\nQuinacridone Magenta \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcq\nAmazon https://amzn.to/34rtEt7\n\nUltramarine Blue \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcs\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3f7k9RX\n\nHansa Yellow Opaque \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcu\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3sYSB9w\n\nCarbon Black \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcx\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3qRnNoe\n\nACRYLIC RETARDERS\nYou can add retarder to any brand of acrylics to make them dry slower. This is useful if you already have a brand of acrylics that you prefer. Follow the instructions, you usually don't want to add any more than 25%-30% retarder because it may take too long to dry. The paint may remain tacky even after it dries if you add too much. \n\nGolden Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5mc\nLiquitex Slo-Dri Medium http://shrsl.com/2j5me\nWinsor & Newton Galeria Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5mi\nGrumbacher Artists Acrylic Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5ml\n\nBRUSHES\nI use mostly synthetic brushes that are made for acrylics like these ones from Robert Simmons\nhttp://shrsl.com/3a082\nThe softer brushes are for watercolor.\n\nACRYLIC PALETTES\nThe Masterson Stay Wet Palette is a large plastic box with a tight fitting lid. It comes with a sponge and palette paper. I find that I don't need the sponge to keep the OPEN acrylics wet, but you may need to use it if you live in a very hot and dry climate. It works better than a Tupperware container because the sides of the wall are lower, and it's large. Here is the 12\"x16\" Masterson Palette I use in the video http://shrsl.com/2j5n4\n\nThis is the smaller palette that I store inside of the Masterson Palette.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5nc\n\nSince the OPEN acrylics stay wet for so long, I never really have to peel the paint off. I just clean it with a wet paper towel or rag. I find the microfiber towels work great.\n\nMICROFIBER TOWELS\nI bought a large package of these on Amazon, the link is below. The small fibers create more surface area than paper towels and they do seem to make it easier to clean things. They work great for drying paint brushes and cleaning palettes. Make sure that you handle them properly if you use them with oil paints because they can spontaneously combust.\nhttps://amzn.to/2GdvMsn\n\nTABLE TOP EASEL\nThis is where you can buy the easel I use in the video:\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5ni\n\nI have been using this table top easel for some time now and I like how portable it is. The top folds down and it has a handle which makes it easy to carry. The drawer on the bottom opens to the side and the inside is divided into separate compartments for storing pencils, brushes, and tubes of paint.\n\nPAINT SPATULA\nThis paint spatula from Princeton is handy tool to have in the studio.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5no\n\nCANVAS PANELS\nI've tried out a number or brands of canvas panels, but I'm really fond of the ones made by Raymar. They're acrylic primed and they're backed with a gray melamine that makes them even more resistant to warping. You can buy them on Blick http://shrsl.com/2j5nr\n\nUSING PENCIL TO SKETCH ON CANVAS\nPencils with harder leads are less likely to smear as you paint over them. I discuss this in-depth on my blog.\nhttps://drawandpaintforfun.com/best-pencil-on-canvas/\n\nMUSIC: \"A Night Alone\" by TrackTribe", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 641, "publish_time": "20200930"}

You know the feeling when you‚Äôre half way through a painting and it isn‚Äôt working out? Maybe it‚Äôs not the values, drawing or the colour - very likely it‚Äôs just that the set up was put together too quickly without a lot of thought.\n\nSo it's really worth takng some time to learn how to set up a still life. Good still life paintings (and most paintings, really) rely on the pattern of lights and darks, and you can create that before you even squeeze out any paint by carefully putting together the still life composition on your stand. If it looks beautiful before you start painting, you have a much better chance of getting a beautiful painting when you‚Äôre finished.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1052, "publish_time": "20210123"}

It produced reasonable power from 1250rpm and crested at around 4500rpm, providing a near perfect torque band before reaching the speed cutoff at 7000rpm. \n\nBecause BMW intended the engine to function reliably and retain the feel of a much larger v8, throttle lag was practically non-existent (for a turbo engine). \n\nThe N55 prefers higher octane gasoline because it provides more power and better efficiency, with most users saying that the expense per mile is the same as when using low octane fuel. \n\nThe N54 and N55 engines were identical in many ways, but the most notable change was that the later N55 model had a contemporary single twinscroll turbine, as opposed to the N54's twin-turbocharger.\n\nA single turbo is less expensive, lighter, and has a few advantages, but the twin-turbo configuration provides more possible power increases from upgrades. However, the benefits of a bigger single twin scroll turbo are still substantial and sufficient for most tuning tasks. Surprisingly, Alpina chose a twin turbo system in their performance versions. Generally, the N55 improved on the N54 and was in production from 2009 to 2015, when it was superseded by the B57 engine. \n\nWith the introduction of the Alpina tuned models we saw the N55 factory power varies from a respectable 302 bhp to 425 bhp and with mapping adjustments it is possible to add around 80hp on the basic engine.\n\nAir Induction kits and Exhaust will NOT usually ADD TORQUE for most stock N55 configurations on their own, but they will allow you to increase power after other improvements by removing the limitation you hit with other mods as the factory setup runs out of capacity to cope. \n\nFlowing and porting the Head - Flowing and porting the head will get air streaming into the engine while eliminating turbulence or limitations. \n\nTurbo upgrades - forced induction is the most important method to increase the air flow to your intake, enabling you to consume more gasoline and gain power. \n\nN55 remapping offers the most power for the money, but new ECUs and integrated Tuning boxes are also options.\n\nChapters\n0:00 Intro\n2:34 Spark Plug Selection\n3:00 Intercoolers\n4:07 Turbo Upgrades\n6:00 Fuel - Port Injection Fuel Types\n6:17 Engine Tuning (Remapping)\n8:08 Induction Kits & Intakes\n9:05 Head Work Gas Flowing Valves\n10:15 Stronger Engine Parts\n11:11 Injector Upgrades\n12:02 Exhaust Mods \n14:20 Forged Crank Pistons\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IG-bqFLaujU?t=181 Intercoolers\n\nThe following cars came with the N55 engine: 2009‚Äì2017 F10/F11/F07 535i, 2010‚Äì2013 E90/E91/E92/E93 335i, 2010‚Äì2013 E82/E88 135i, 2010‚Äì2017 F25 X3 xDrive35i, 2011‚Äì2013 E70 X5 xDrive35i, 2011‚Äì2015 F30/F31 335i, 2011‚Äì2014 E71 X6 xDrive35i, 2012‚Äì2015 E84 X1 xDrive35i, 2013‚Äì2016 F32/F33/F36 435i, 2014‚Äì2018 F15 X5 xDrive35i, 2014‚Äì2019 F16 X6 xDrive35i, and 2014‚Äì2016 F26 X4 xDrive35i. It has different variations, including N55B30, N55B30O0, N55HP, and N55B30T0.

It was the custom shop behind the first really mainstream car show, Pimp My Ride, and since Pimp My  Ride ended the shop has gone on to be behind another car show named Inside West Coast Customs. \n\nThe shop has a very interesting history too and is probably the one shop in the world that does not have an exact founding date. According to some, the shop was founded way back in 1994, and others say it was 1997.\n\nIn any case, what we do know for sure is that the shop was incorporated in the year 2000 by Ryan Friedlinghaus, a young mechanic who had a passion for building custom made cars. \n\nHowever, Friedlinghaus had discovered quite early in his life that there were almost no garages that could do all everything needed to make a custom car in-house. \n\nSo he created West Coast Customs as a shop that could make custom cars from top to bottom without outsourcing any part of the vehicle. That was his vision for West Coast Customs, and for a while, that was precisely what the shop was. \n\nAt first, the shop did not get a lot of orders, but soon celebrities like Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal started bringing their expensive cars around for custom effects and that is when West Coast Customs blew up.\n\nBefore long, the shop drew the attention of media giants MTV and they pitched the show Pimp My Ride to Friedlinghaus. But here was the catch, Friedlinghaus was not going to be the host of the show. It would merely be hosted in his shop and he would be the one to coordinate the actual work on the vehicles. The real host of the show would be a rapper named Xzibit. \n\nIn the end, Pimp My Ride was a successful show, but after the first few years, West Coast Customs started seeing the first problems that would eventually run the shop out of reality TV shows forever. \n\n#InsideWestCoastCustoms", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 507, "publish_time": "20220627"}

First off, there's not a single Porsche part on the car.\n\nPorsche Engineering Services helped with reengineering the W124's engine compartment to fit in the 32-valve, 4-cam M119 V-8 ‚Äî for both the 400E and the 500E.\n\nBut the 500E doesn't use the same V-8 as the 500SL. It needed shorter connecting rods so that it fit in the same physical space as the 4.2-liter 400E ‚Äî this way only one structural variant needed to be produced.\n\nThe 400E was a response to the Lexus LS400. Why do you think it wasn't called a 420E?\n\nPorsche also did the engineering to bolt up wheels, tires, brakes, and suspension components from the wider and heavier R129 500SL and W124 500SEL. That necessitated fender flares so wide that the 500E didn't fit down the regular W124 production line in Sindelfingen. \n\nFor both models, Porsche performed the physical modifications to Mercedes-built W124 chassis, and sent them back to Sindelfingen for paint. The 400E remained there, but because of its width, the 500E was sent back to Porsche, which assembled the 500E at a second Zuffenhausen factory.\n\nWith Bruno Sacco's revolutionary looks, aerodynamics, obsession with safety, and Mercedes build quality and engineering might, the W124 was certainly among the best (and most expensive) sedans in the world.\n\nStill is. It's close to perfect. But it's not a Porsche Sports Sedan.\n\n=\n\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

If you‚Äôre looking for a simple yet very effective way of losing weight and improving your overall health, walking is something just for you. \nPeople who are physically active throughout their life are much less prone to this disease than those who have a more sedentary lifestyle. And that‚Äôs because they have more volume in their hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning.   \nA daily half-hour walk helps avoid serious problems, like coronary heart disease to name one, by lowering high blood pressure and cholesterol levels and improving blood circulation. Because of better-quality and deeper breathing, some symptoms associated with lung disease can show significant improvement thanks to walking. \nMuscle tone and weight loss is also totally achievable through simple walking. Find your optimal pace, but don‚Äôt break out into a jog. This sort of speed walking is low impact and doesn‚Äôt require any recovery time, which means no sore muscles to keep you from getting out and walking the next day.\nThe Arthritis Foundation recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate walking a day to reduce pain, stiffness, and inflammation in the joints. Building strong bones will help you prevent osteoporosis and reduce bone loss. Walking contributes to better blood circulation within the spinal structures, pumping important nutrients into the soft tissues and improving posture and flexibility, both of which are vital for a healthy spine.\nA group of researchers at Iowa State University worked with hundreds of college students. Walking changed their mood for the better, even though no one warned them it could do so.\nIf you still don‚Äôt feel motivated enough to start walking for your health, try joining a class or find a buddy who also wouldn‚Äôt mind getting all the benefits of walking. Another idea could be to hire a personal trainer.\n\nMusic: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music\n\nTIMESTAMPS\nBrain-boosting effect 0:45\nImproved eyesight 1:44\nPrevention of heart disease 2:47\nIncreased lung volume 3:14\nBenefits for the pancreas 3:51\nImproved digestion 4:23\nToned muscles 4:59\nSturdier bones and joints 5:45\nBack pain relief 6:10\nA calmer mind 7:04\nBonus: the FIT formula 8:00\n\nSUMMARY\n-Walking prevents the early onset of dementia, reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and improves your overall mental well-being by reducing stress and releasing endorphins.\n-Get on the road to improve vision and protect your eyes now from potential problems, such as glaucoma, in the future. \n-Walking is no less effective than running when it comes to the prevention of heart disease and stroke.\n-Walking is an aerobic exercise, which means that it increases oxygen flow in the bloodstream and helps eliminate toxins and waste, which is great for your lungs. \n-Walking for exercise is a surprisingly more effective way to prevent diabetes than running is.\n-Just half an hour of walking every day not only lowers the risk of developing colon cancer but also improves digestion and regulates bowel movements.\n-Just 10,000 steps a day can be just as effective as a full-blown workout at the gym, especially if you add some intervals or uphill walking.\n-Walking can provide more joint mobility, prevent the loss of bone density, and even reduce the risk of fractures.\n-Walking is a real life-saver for those who experience back pain during more challenging high-impact exercises.\n-Walking improves depression symptoms in patients with MDD, just imagine how easily it could help us cope with just feeling down or exhausted.\n-Keep in mind the FIT formula.

Furthermore, nearly 80% of those individuals who suffer a sprain are likely to experience re-injury.\n\nA number of studies have demonstrated the positive effects of exercise for treating ankle sprains, but researchers have questioned how the addition of manual therapy might influence outcomes.\n\nIn 2013, Cleland and colleagues demonstrated that those put in a manual therapy (joint mobilizations) plus exercise group did better in terms of pain and function than those in an exercise-only group at 4 weeks and 6 months.\n\nThere is a lot of hate out there right now for manual therapy, and while I realize exercise has the best evidence, ankle sprains may be one issue where seeing a physio for a combination of skilled manual care and exercise guidance would be wise.\n\nReferences: \n\n1.

However, is this a valid perspective? Well, to determine if heavy and light weight training cause different effects, we need to look at the research. After reviewing the research out there, it seems that using heavy or light weights actually doesn‚Äôt matter much in terms of hypertrophy. Studies show that muscle growth tends to be equal despite using light weights or heavy weights (high rep vs low rep). But this is only true when going to near failure, and one benefit of lifting heavy weights is the better strength gains you see when compared to light weights. Based on this, as you‚Äôll see in my video, your best bet is to incorporate high reps with light weights AND low reps with heavy weights into your workout. This will enable you to target both metabolic stress and mechanical tension; both are important mechanisms of muscle growth. \n\nLIGHT WEIGHTS VS HEAVY WEIGHTS ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/light-weights-heavy-weights/ \n\n You can browse around my website and read the articles I do have up (I‚Äôll be adding more articles on a regular basis).

Dr. Mandell", "description": "Engaging in calf pumps while seated offers an array of health benefits that extend far beyond simple leg exercise. Firstly, this activity significantly enhances circulation by utilizing the \"muscle pump\" mechanism. When the calf muscles contract, they compress the veins running through them, effectively pushing blood upward towards the heart. The one-way valves in these veins prevent the blood from flowing back down, ensuring efficient venous return and reducing the risk of blood pooling, swelling, and conditions like varicose veins. Improved circulation means that oxygen and nutrients are more effectively delivered throughout the body, supporting overall cellular function and health.\n\nAdditionally, calf pumps play a crucial role in blood sugar regulation. The muscle contractions increase glucose uptake from the bloodstream into the muscle cells, where it is used for energy, thereby helping to lower blood sugar levels. This process also improves insulin sensitivity, meaning the body requires less insulin to manage blood glucose levels effectively. Enhanced insulin sensitivity is particularly beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, as it helps to maintain more stable blood sugar levels and reduces the risk of postprandial glucose spikes.\n\nMoreover, calf pumps can significantly aid in digestion. The improved circulation ensures that digestive organs receive a better supply of oxygen and nutrients, which enhances their functionality. The physical activity also stimulates the autonomic nervous system, promoting peristalsis‚Äîthe wave-like contractions that move food through the digestive tract. This helps to prevent common digestive issues such as bloating and constipation, leading to more efficient digestion and nutrient absorption.\n\nIncorporating regular calf pumps while seated can also help reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition that can occur during prolonged periods of inactivity, such as long flights or desk jobs. By promoting blood flow and reducing stasis in the veins, calf pumps serve as a preventative measure against this potentially serious condition. Additionally, improved lymphatic circulation facilitated by these exercises aids in the removal of metabolic waste products, contributing to overall better health and reduced inflammation.\n\nIn summary, the simple act of performing calf pumps while seated offers numerous health benefits, including enhanced circulation, improved blood sugar regulation and insulin sensitivity, better digestion, and protection against conditions like DVT. This easy-to-implement activity is a powerful tool for maintaining and improving overall health, especially for individuals who spend extended periods sitting.\n\n****************************************************\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

This video provides information about the cerebellum connection.  All balancing exercises in this video are inspired by the book ADHD 2.0 by Edward Hallowell and John Ratey.  The balancing exercises in this video target the cerebellum and the vestibular system of the inner ear. These two areas combined are referred to as the vestibulo cerebellar system.  Compelling evidence from research citings in this book suggest that strengthening this system not only improves physical skill but also attention and focus and emotional regulation. Chapter three of this book goes into detail regarding the cerebellum connection. What interested me the most about this connection is the affect of calming emotions.  I've personally tried balancing exercises with children who struggle with emotional dysregulation and I've seen first had how the balancing is used as a \"bottom up\" regulation tool that younger children can access to help bring balance to an emotionally hijacked brain. Since their frontal lobes are so underdeveloped (the frontal lobes are used for \"top down\" regulation techniques), this is an exciting intervention for them to experience.  The book introduces the concept of stimulating the cerebellum through balance to regulate emotions and increase focus and attention. Since reading ADHD 2.0 I have introduced all the children and teens I work with to balancing exercises and I made this video for them to practice over the summer and outside of school hours.  This is just an introduction to some of the most popular balancing activities.  I've also incorporated some Bal-a-Vis-X with the two small rubber balls and the cross body movements.  \n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nThe balance board can be found on Amazon.\n\nBook: ADHD 2.0  (found on Amazon and other book sellers).\n\nThe book mentions a program called Zing Performance.

This all happens in the blink of an eye. Even at a younger age you will see people who play sports can do this much faster and land much more safely than people who do not play sport. This is a skill that can be trained and needs constant exposure to maintain it's fast response. A very slow response is what you see with an older person who has not spent time developing skills of balance, agility and power. The chance of a injury from a fall is very likely. \n\n\nMost of the current core workouts is all about training abdominal muscles in isolation using crunches, planks, and various other floor based exercises. The belief here is that if you train your core like you would with a bicep curl to make a bicep stronger, you will have improved balance and function. Unfortunately it does not work this way at all. For starters there is no need for fast reflex reactions as you are already on the floor. Secondly, planks and other traditional abdominal exercises are of little use to the older adult and more likely to cause more harm than good for these exercises are all about stiffness and rigidity. The older adult already has too much stiffness and rigidity, they do not need more.\n\nThe key is in using exercises that demand a reflex response that can teach them more effective ways to restore balance and stability.\n\nWe know the amazing benefits of agility training with sports for improving reaction times and reflex skills. The same is true for older adults but instead of improved sporting performance we may be able to save their life!\n\nStatistics in the US show that one adult over the age of 65 is treated in the emergency room for a fall every 18 seconds (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Quite an alarming statistic and even more scary when you consider that hip fractures are the most common injury from a fall and the number one cause of nursing home admission. Approximately 50% of those who suffer a hip fracture never fully regain their mobility and independence, and 50% of those die within the first year! Falling for an older adult is a very serious matter, and a life threatening situation. \n\nOther great articles to read about this subject are below\n\nStability Training What Is It Really & How To Do It\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/246-stability-training-what-is-it-really-why-is-it-so-important\n\nStrength Training For Older Adults\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/179-can-you-slow-the-ageing-process-with-exercise\n\nReduce Arthritis & Improve Bone Density\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/214-how-to-reduce-arthritis-symptoms-improve-overall-bone-density\n\nAnd if you live in Melbourne and would like to know more about our specific Older Adults Strength Training program go to our website in the link below\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/187-stronger-for-longer-older-adults-training", "quality": "1440x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20190221"}

You see, the core is generally made up of four key components. Namely - the rectus abdominus (6pack / lower abs), obliques, the serratus anterior, and the transverse abdominus (inner abs).\n\nüëâCoaching Programs: https://www.fraserwilsonfitness.com\n\nThe obliques are an absolute must when it comes to developing an aesthetic physique. If your goal is to attain the V tapered look, there‚Äôs no way around training them. The obliques are a multifunctional muscle, they act to pull the chest downwards and compress the abdominal cavity, as well as performing side bending and opposing side rotation. Overall, you can‚Äôt skimp on your obliques for aesthetic and performance, and the best way to ensure that you stay on track is to keep your workouts fresh & challenging\n\nThe serratus is a muscle that originates on your upper rib cage and attaches to the media border of the shoulder blade (basically the shark gill looking things). The serratus muscles play a pivotal role in framing out your abs, obliques and lower pec. Not too mention, it absolutely serves as an asset to the v taper, in turn giving you a better looking set of abs!\n\nThis video is full length which means you can just follow along with whatever I'm doing.

You've come to the right place!\n\n\n---\n\n\nWhy do you get so sore after leg day?\n\n\nWe know that our muscles get sore when we work them hard, whether that‚Äôs through lifting heavy weights, doing tons of reps, or burning them out through long or intense cardio.\n\n\nBut why do legs get more sore than your other muscles? \n\n\nThe simple answer is that there are many muscles in your legs, and they‚Äôre quite large‚Ä¶ which means it‚Äôs a lot harder for them to recover.\n\n\nThere are two different kinds of muscle soreness you should be aware of.\n\n\nThe first kind of muscle soreness is acute, or immediate soreness. As you challenge your muscles, they build up lactic acid, which is what causes the familiar ‚Äúburning sensation‚Äù you get right before your muscles fail.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs this quick onset soreness that you feel in the gym, between sets, or right after you finish your workout.\n\n\nIt typically won‚Äôt last more than a few minutes, or at worst, a few hours after you finish working out.\n\n\nThe second kind of muscle soreness, and the kind that can make leg day miserable, is delayed soreness, often called DOMS or Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.\n\n\nDOMS is exactly what it sounds like, and it explains why your legs are so sore the next day or two after a tough leg workout.\n\n\nOn a physiological level, the process of lifting weights and building muscle involves causing lots of microscopic tears in your muscle fibers. When these tears are repaired through rest, nutrition, and recovery, you build new muscle and gain strength.\n\n\nBut in the meantime, it can hurt‚Ä¶ a lot! The micro-tears in your muscles will swell, become inflamed, and cause you some pain while they‚Äôre recovering.\n\n\nMost experts believe DOMS are worse in your legs because of the large size of the muscle groups, and the fact that you‚Äôll lift heavier loads than you would during, say, a bicep curl.\n\n\nSo now that you understand a little bit of the science behind leg soreness, you know that it‚Äôs totally normal, and is often a sign of a great workout!\n\n\nBut what can you do to ease that soreness? Here are 5 tips that might help.\n----\n1. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate\n\n\nThis is a good idea on almost any day, but it counts double for recovering from leg day.\n\n\nMake sure you hydrate plenty before, during, and after your workout, as well as in the days following it while you recover.\n\n\nProper hydration helps your muscles heal and delivers nutrients to the parts of your body that need it the most.\n\n\nThere‚Äôs no hard and fast rule for this, but you‚Äôll sometimes see health experts recommend the 8 by 8 approach ‚Äî that‚Äôs eight 8 ounce glasses of water every day.\n---\n\n\n2. Stretch out those quads and hammies!\n\n\nMost people know the importance of properly warming up, but just as important (and probably even more likely to be skipped) is a good cool-down session.\n\n\nAfter squats or deadlifts, you‚Äôll probably be exhausted and ready to go home. But if you‚Äôre having major leg soreness or trouble walking, it‚Äôs probably worth taking a few minutes to stretch after your leg day workout.\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to go overboard, just get a nice deep stretch on your major leg muscles before you call it a day. If it‚Äôs too late and you‚Äôre already home and feeling sore, a good stretch will still help blood flow and recovery in those muscle groups.\n---\n\n\n3. Walk, do yoga, or hit the stationary bike \n\n\nEven though you might be in pain, sitting on the couch doing nothing is probably not the right way to go.\n\n\nGetting back to the gym, if possible, and doing some light work on the stationary bike is PERFECT for leg recovery. It‚Äôs low impact, easy, and will promote great circulation.\n\n\nA gentle yoga class or a long walk are also great options.\n\n\nIt might hurt at first if your legs are really sore, but it should help alleviate the pain sooner than remaining sedentary would.\n---\n\n\n4. Ice those legs down\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre having a brutal leg day hangover, it‚Äôs because you did some serious damage to your muscles on a microscopic level. (Congrats on a great workout, by the way!)\n\n\nAs we talked about above, those little tears and abrasions are going to swell up and feel awful in the process of healing.\n\n\nSo what do you do when something swells up? You ice it down!\n\n\nAn ice pack on your legs will actually narrow the blood vessels and reduce the blood flow to the area, which will help the swelling go down and get you back on your feet.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not ideal for nutrient delivery and recovery, but it will help ease the pain.\n---\n\n\n5. Use a foam roller\n\n\nFoam rollers are a FANTASTIC accessory that can help you work out knots in your muscles, improve mobility, avoid injuries, and promote better recovery after workouts.\n\n\nWhen all else fails and the soreness is just too deep in your muscles, and especially if you‚Äôre having trouble walking, using one of these can really help loosen you back up.\n\n\nLook up a few foam rolling exercises that target your legs and pay careful attention to the technique to get the best results.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20221115"}

Dr. Mandell", "description": "Utilizing a towel as a simple yet effective tool can significantly enhance foot and leg circulation, particularly after a rigorous workout session. Following a day filled with exercises that engage the lower body, a towel can be employed for gentle stretching and massaging, which can help alleviate discomfort and promote better blood flow. To begin, you might sit comfortably on the floor or on a chair or sofa, draping the towel around the arch of your foot while holding the ends. Gently pulling the towel towards you will provide a safe stretch for the calf muscles and Achilles tendon, aiding flexibility and circulation. This stretch not only helps in loosening tight muscles but also encourages venous return, reducing the risk of developing varicose veins and minimizing swelling in the ankles and feet.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating rhythmic movements with the towel can further enhance circulation. For instance, you can perform a \"towel scrunch,\" where you place a towel on the floor and use your toes to scrunch it up towards you. This exercise engages the small muscles in the feet, stimulating blood flow and strengthening foot muscles, thus promoting overall leg health. Using the towel as a prop in various exercises, such as leg extensions or lateral leg raises, can facilitate a greater range of motion and improve circulation in the legs. By engaging in these practices regularly, you not only support your muscle recovery post-workout but also cultivate a habit that promotes long-term circulation health, helping to keep your legs feeling light and energized! Remember, integrating such mindful practices into your routine can significantly impact your overall well-being, helping to prevent discomfort and enhance the vitality of your lower extremities.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

Stick around till the end of this video as we dig up the dirt on your dog's incredible abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDogs can detect a mean person\nAccording to a study published in the journal of Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, dogs can tell when someone is mean to you!  \nIn three different scenarios, a dog owner was trying to open a container that was tightly sealed with an actor standing next to them. The first actor helped open the container, the second was passive, and the third outright refused to help. \nScientists found that the dogs were much more likely to accept a treat from the actor who tried to help and showed kindness toward the owner.  \nMost dogs also accepted food from the passive actor, but they were not willing to trust the person who didn‚Äôt lend a hand. \nDogs can detect liars\nAnother study conducted in Japan followed a similar experiment to find out if dogs can recognize an untrustworthy person. \nIn this experiment, the scientists placed two containers near the dogs. One had treats inside, but the other was empty. In the first test, a person pointed to the container that concealed a treat, but the second time, the person pointed to the empty container instead. \nThe dogs were happy to find the treat the first round, but were disappointed when they found out they were lied to in the second time. Then, the third round, the person pointed to the container with the treat again. However, that time, the dogs did not go for it. That person had been untrustworthy and deceitful in the second round, and the dog remembered that. \nDogs can remember their owner‚Äôs scent forever\nDogs can remember the scent of their owners for their entire life. \nA dog‚Äôs memory is so complex that they will remember emotions associated with their owner or a person they met. The association of how that person made the dog feel remains stored in the dog‚Äôs brain.\nWhen a dog recognizes a particular scent associated with a human that has brought them joy, a particular portion of their brain is triggered, and they remember them. \nStudies have shown that an owner‚Äôs scent activates the pleasure centers in the dog‚Äôs brain. It‚Äôs similar to the way the human brain responds to the perfume or cologne of a loved one.\nDogs can interpret facial expressions.\nIn a touchscreen experiment in Austria, scientists put dogs to the test. \nWhen the dogs were shown angry or happy faced pictures of people they hadn‚Äôt seen before, they were still able to tell the difference and earn that reward. \nThe scientists say that the experiment proves that dogs can discriminate between the two human expressions. Dogs had a natural aversion to pressing their noses against pictures of angry faces. This means that our furry friends have some knowledge about the meaning behind human expressions. \nDogs can smell bad intentions\nIf your dog barks at some people, but not the others, it could be that your dog picks up on subconscious signals you send about those people. \nOutwardly, you may be being welcoming and friendly to a person, but your dog will notice tiny, subconscious signals that you are not completely comfortable around that person. \nYour dog can sense when you are nervous because your body produces certain stress-related chemicals and hormones that have distinctive odors. \nOn that note, remember that dogs can smell fear. In a study of 694 people, the scientists found a link between an individual‚Äôs emotional state and their likelihood of getting bitten. Confident and emotionally stable people didn't get bitten nearly as often as those who feel anxious around intimidating dogs. \nDogs can read your body language.\nAccording to animal behavior specialists, canines will pick up on every move a dog or human makes. \nThis is because dogs rely on canine body language to assess their own safety when they are around other dogs. \nDogs can smell serious illnesses\nBelieve it or not, dogs can detect cancer. Simply by sniffing someone‚Äôs body. \nA study conducted at the University of California Davis has shown that dogs can detect Cancer-affected tissues out of many samples.\nDogs can even be life-savers for people with diabetes.\nA dog‚Äôs super nose can also predict seizures, and migraines, and can detect malaria and Parkinson‚Äôs disease. \nNow, let‚Äôs talk about why dogs bark at some dogs, but not the others.\nWhile humans communicate using words, dogs mainly communicate through their body language and scent.\nYour dog may bark at some dogs because they show threatening body language and have an off-putting scent.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 579, "publish_time": "20211217"}

The sanctuary protects extensive coral reefs, including some of the oldest and largest Porites coral heads in the world, along with deep water reefs, hydrothermal vent communities, and rare marine archaeological resources, and also encompasses important fishing grounds, the southernmost point in the United States, and waters surrounding one of the world‚Äôs smallest atolls. The sanctuary is also the only true tropical reef within the National Marine Sanctuary System, and is the most remote location within that system. NOAA co-manages the sanctuary with the American Samoa Government and works closely with communities adjacent to the sanctuary, all within the context of Samoan cultural traditions and practices.\nhttp://americansamoa.noaa.gov/\n\nAbout Ocean Futures Society\n\nOur mission is to explore our global ocean, inspiring and educating people\nthroughout the world to act responsibly for its protection, documenting\nthe critical connection between humanity and nature, and celebrating the\nocean's vital importance to the survival of all life on our planet.\nhttp://www.oceanfutures.org/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 350, "publish_time": "20161005"}

Subscribe to our channel: https://bit.ly/371k8sN \n\nEvery day for the 116 days that System 001 was offshore, a team of scientists and experts monitored the system and the surrounding environment to understand the possible impact of the technology and to minimize any potential harm to marine life. Initial results indicate minimal effects on marine life and the team will continue to study and evaluate this important work when we launch System 001/B.\n\nAs we are well into the testing with System 001/B in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, Boyan sat with Technology Manager, Arjen Tjallema, at our headquarters in Rotterdam to discuss the complexities of iteratively designing and testing the cleanup technology in this particular offshore environment. Although this does entail its challenges, we aim to reach proven technology with this system, but, regardless of the outcome, the many learnings from this campaign will be applied to refining and improving our design and processes.\n\nIn four months, we designed, procured, assembled, and launched an entirely new system, dubbed System 001/B. This variation of System 001 entails modifications aimed at addressing the plastic retention issue we faced with Wilson. To learn quickly and achieve faster iterations cycles, speed is key with this design. This is how we got there and what our next steps will be.\n\nRead more about our monitoring efforts in the full update:\nhttps://theoceancleanup.com/updates/mission-one-environmental-monitoring-results-available/\n\nAnd follow The Ocean Cleanup on:\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QWgmLQ\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2RqHqSk\nInstagram: https://bit.ly/2st9SKT\n\n#theoceancleanup", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 312, "publish_time": "20190607"}

My recommendations explain briefly what makes each racket suitable for different playing styles. \nYou can always give us a call or drop us a line on email or via social media if you'd like more advice. \n\n1. Best for Intermediate players: Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 X-Speed \n2. Best-selling: Dunlop Aerogel 4D Elite\n3. Best for club players: Head Graphene Cyano 115\n4. Best for performance: Dunlop Sonic Core Ultimate 132\n5. Best for power: Prince Venom Pro 950\n\n\n1. Best for Intermediate players: Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 X-Speed\nThe Tecnifibre Carboflex X-Speed is the third version in the ever popular Carboflex models. It offers fantastic power and forgiveness making it ideal for the attacking players. The X-Speed range featured a new AeroShaft design to provide more control and feel than the previous versions. At 125grams this racket offers greater manoeuvrability than the heavier models in the range.\nhttps://www.pdhsports.com/i/q/RSTE10840/tecnifibre-carboflex-125-x-speed-squash-racket\n\n2. Best-selling: Dunlop Aerogel 4D Elite\nThe Dunlop Aerogel 4D Elite was previously used by World no.1 Gregory Gaultier. It uses 4D braided technology to improve frame stability, increasing the control and feel. The 135gram frame weight also helps to generate the power needed to boast the ball out of the corners. \nhttps://www.pdhsports.com/i/q/RSDU6722/dunlop-aerogel-4d-elite-squash-racket\n\n3. Best for club players: Head Graphene Cyano 115\nAn exclusive racket to pdhsports.com, the Head Graphene Cyano 115 is my go-to racket when asked for recommendations for club players. It is a lightweight racket with a head heavy balance to help pack a punch. The teardrop headshape helps to increase the forgiveness of the racket, so even the off-centred shots come off better. \nhttps://www.pdhsports.com/i/q/RSHE3912/head-graphene-cyano-115-squash-racket\n\n4. Best for performance: Dunlop Sonic Core Ultimate 132\nLaunched in 2020, the Dunlop Sonic Core range uses technology that really makes a difference on court. The new Infinergy technology allows you to player harder and cleaner shots, whilst an aerodynamic cross section increases manoeuvrability. This racket is endorsed by Diego Elias and Millie Tomlinson. \nhttps://www.pdhsports.com/i/q/RSDU19040/dunlop-sonic-core-ultimate-132-squash-racket\n\n5. Best for power: Prince Venom Pro 950\n\"No racket plays like a Prince racket!\"\nPrince rackets have a distinct playing feel that no other brands can replicate. Their famous Power Ring technology increases the length of the main strings to get power like never before. This racket also uses of the O3 port techhology to increase the manoeuvrability and allows you to hit with more control when you need it. \nhttps://www.pdhsports.com/i/q/RSPR13613/prince-venom-pro-950-squash-racket\n\nPaul's choice: \"I would have to choose the Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 X-Speed. For me it's the greatest squash racket of all time. This is my current racket of choice and performs so well in all areas of my game. For a teardrop shape you will not find a racket with more control and power from any other brand. \"", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 432, "publish_time": "20210129"}

But why exactly do cats have whiskers?\n\nTHE ANATOMY OF THE WHISKER\n\nA common mistake people make is assuming that cat whiskers and human hair are alike. The whiskers, unlike human hair, are actually touch receptors. These longer, stiffer hairs -- also called vibrissae -- are embedded more deeply in the cat‚Äôs body than the shorter top-fur coat. The vibrissae are connected securely to the sensitive muscular and nervous systems, sending information about the surroundings directly to the cat‚Äôs sensory nerves, giving it a heightened sense of feeling and helping the cat to detect and respond to changes in its surroundings - sort of like kitty radar.\n\nClick the PayPal Donate Link below to support my \nChannel https://www.paypal.me/htung147\nMy Cat Will Love you so much !!!\n\n‚òÜ Link Video: https://www..com/watch?v=Y308kEtoqdc\n‚òÜ Subscribe : https://lnkd.in/fZECyBc\n‚òÜ Maybe you want to see more:\n\nMy channel : https://www..com/channel/UCBn8kw_EI2In6HPuWoUvUqg \nCats - First Time In A New Home | Funny Video Cat 2017 | Meo Cover Home https://www..com/watch?v=2P3TLFd2SOM\nMy KittensTwo Day So Cute | Cat Gives Birth To Kittens | Meo Cover Home https://www..com/watch?v=nrS5s9wL-S4\nMy Cat Gives Birth To 5 Kittens So Cute | Cat Gives Birth To Kittens | Meo Cover Home \nhttps://www..com/watch?v=X7l23k0Q8sU&t=13s\n3 Moment So Cute Of My Cat | Funny Video Cat 2017 | Best Ever Moment Cat 2017 https://www..com/watch?v=ubvfTYLe9Bs&t=11s\nCat Begging For Food So Cute | Cat Eat Food | Meo Cover Home https://www..com/watch?v=iqGGVdu50Fo&t=21s\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n‚ñ∫ About Animals Giving Birth Tv\n‚ñ∫ About us:\n‚ñÆ Website : http://timocat2016.blogspot.com/\n‚ñÆ Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/Animalsplus/...\n‚ñÆ Email : tunghai22@gmail.com\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n‚ñ∫‚ñ∫‚ñ∫‚ñ∫‚ñ∫‚ñ∫‚ñ∫‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ THANKS FOR WATCHING ‚óÑ‚óÑ‚óÑ‚óÑ‚óÑ‚óÑ‚óÑ‚óÑ‚óÑ\n‚ñ∫ AND DON'T FORGET TO LIKE COMMENTS AND SUBSCRIBE\n\nCopyrighted song: Garden Adventure - Intermede - Reliable Source MusicC", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 627, "publish_time": "20180226"}

Keep using the 12 if it suits you, but as a teaching device I find the 21 to be far more comprehensive.\n\nRead the full essay (link above) for more detail.

In an illuminating and provocative new study, Kiri Paramore analyses the dynamic history of Japanese Confucianism, revealing its many cultural manifestations, as religion and as a political tool, as social capital and public discourse, as well as its role in international relations and statecraft. The book demonstrates the processes through which Confucianism was historically linked to other phenomenon, such as the rise of modern science and East Asian liberalism. In doing so, it offers new perspectives on the sociology of Confucianism and its impact on society, culture and politics across East Asia, past and present.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 412, "publish_time": "20160323"}

Be aware that just because these exercises are in the introductory video doesn't mean they're easy! You can simply add more resistance to match your current skill level. \n\n1. Eccentric wrist to finger curls\nStart with your wrist in supination (palm up) and with a weight in your hand. Fully flex your wrist. Next, slowly lower the weight down first by extending at the wrist then start to open your hand as if the weight were to fall from your fingertips. You should count to at least 5 full seconds during this motion. Once at the end of the movement, curl the weight back to the starting position. Hold briefly at the starting position, then repeat. \nNote: 1-hand is easier than 2 hand setups as most 2 handset ups require use of an olympic bar which may be a standard 45 pounds. Once you can tolerate this weight, I recommend performing 2 hand because it is more efficient and forces you to remain in supination. \n\n2. Eccentric reverse curls \nAgain, 2 hand is preferred for efficiency and because with a 1 hand set up you are more likely to leave the pronated position of the wrist and rather will perform more of a hammer curl which will work your brachioradialis more, rather than working the wrist extensors. \nWith a two hand grip in the pronated position, wrap your thumb OVER the bar (thumb will be next to your index finger) rather than under the bar. This over grip will force you to use your finger flexors, which is ideal for climbing. \nStart with the bar by your thighs, elbows in extension. Curl the bar up to your chest. Next, slowly lower the bar down over at least 5 full seconds. Raise the bar back up and repeat. \n\n3. Eccentric pronation / supination \nThis can be accomplished in many ways, but one way I love is with a PVC pipe as you can easily change the weight. This also allows you to work on both eccentric pronation and eccentric supination. A free weight is also possible but is more challenging to adjust to the proper level of difficulty. \nGrab the pipe and start with it facing straight up. Slowly lower the pipe down until it is parallel to the floor. You should count at least 5 seconds before you return to the start position. Next, lower the pipe down the opposite direction. Again, wait until it is parallel with the floor. \nNote: you can perform both hands at the same time if you use a free weight. \n\n4. Knuckle push ups \nThis is a basic initiation into closed chain wrist stabilization. This is necessary to build proprioception or joint awareness during your exercise. \nIf you cannot do a push up it is OK to perform them on your knees. Also, if you cannot go through a large range of motion, no worries! Keep them shallow at first and work on increasing your depth. \nIf you have pain at the knuckles simply add a yoga mat or light padding. This will add some instability so be careful, but it also has the benefit of working on more stability!\n\n5. Plank shoulder taps\nStart in a push up position with a closed fist. It is easier if you start with your hands narrow and your feet wide. Keep your core tight, and tap the right hand to the left shoulder. Hold briefly, replace your hand, then perform on the other side. \nProgression: touch your thigh on the same side (right hand touches right thigh) or make your feet more narrow, this will force you to use more core. \n\n6. Plank Clocks \nPlace an exercise band such as a theraband loop around both wrists. Keep the band just above the bend at your wrist to force your body to stabilize itself. Position: feet wide and your starting hand under the center of your chest. Movement: take your right hand and reach towards 1:00, 3:00, and 5:00. Repeat as tolerated or until fatigued. Switch hands and repeat\nUse a light band initially or you may fall over. \n\nRan out of room!!

Some deserts are mountainous, others are dry expanses of rock, sand, or salt flats. \n\nThe world‚Äôs largest hot desert, The Sahara, is a subtropical desert in northern Africa. The Sahara Desert is almost the size of the United States. \n\nThe islands which are closest to the African mainland, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, are effectively desert or semi desert and are also considered subtropical deserts. These volcanic islands are known as The Canary Islands and are officially part of Spain's territory, historically they been considered a link between the four continents of Africa, North America, South America, and Europe.  Now they are an attractive destination for over 12 million visitors each year who want to enjoy a warm climate all year around and the scenic rugged terrain.\n\nHowever the terrain wasn‚Äôt always like this, the islands were once completely covered in¬†laurel forests, a prehistoric natural treasure. These forests once covered much of Northern Africa and Southern Europe up until roughly 20,000 years ago but due to Human Impact and Global Climate Change they have almost entirely disappeared, except for a few last remaining areas within The Canary Islands which are now being threatened by land degradation due to over tourism and increasing populations since the 1950s, according to this research paper, desertification has intensified in the last 50 years despite the intensive deforestation in 15th and 19th centuries, which also took its toll on the landscape.\n\nLaurel forests are so crucial since they are extremely humid and wet, they are full of biodiversity and are the life support system for these islands, without them the islands would turn completely to desert just like the Sahara next door.\n\nAlmost 330,000 hectares which is 44% of the surface area of the archipelago is affected by severe processes of accelerated water erosion according to the same research paper, titled: Factors and process leading to desertification in The Canary Islands, particularly in Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria are worst affected because of the sparse vegetation and intense human pressure on the land.  Approximately 280,000 hectares which is 38% of the surface area of The Canaries is affected by wind erosion. High salinity of the soil is also a huge issue for agricultural land affecting 84% of farmland.\n\nHowever on the island of Gran Canaria there is a project that is starting to turn this around, in this video we will show you how a new innovative technology is going to capture 215,000 liters of fog and dew to help plant 20,000 laurel trees to stop the advancement of the desert.\n\nCheck out the project: Life Niebles to learn more!\n\n\n\n             __________________________\n  \n\nüîî SUBSCRIBE with Bell notification ON  \n\n‚úç ENQUIRES contact: leafoflifefilms@gmail.com\n\n              _________________________\n\nüå≥ More Greening the City Projects: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLtXoNe4rALdw8AzxzwGfwwPI46K5IIJs\n\n              _________________________\n  \n\nüíö SUPPORT THE CHANNEL \n\nHelp us share more regenerative stories:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/leafoflifefilms \n\nOne time donation:\nhttps://www.paypal.com/paypalme/LeafofLifefilms\n\n              _________________________\n\n     \n\nThis video is for education and research purposes \n\nIf you are the owner of any of the images please contact us an we can credit or remove the image, THANK YOU\n\nFAIR USE COPYRIGHT NOTICE\nThe Copyright Laws of the United States recognizes a ‚Äúfair use‚Äù of copyrighted content.

She's really into skincare and makeup, as am I! And she's a total girls' girl, but can get down with the boys, too. (Plus, she's on one of the most scandalous and morbid shows on the tube, and I love anything creepy or horror-genre related.) \n\nShay joined us on this week's episode of #PrettyUnfiltered while promoting her new partnership with Bior√©, and having interviewed her once before, I knew that she was going to be fun, but also genuine ‚Äî something that's absolutely necessary for our series. After an outfit change on her part, we kicked off our shoes and got to talking.\n\nShay is half Filipina, and growing up, Shays she felt like she didn't fit in. She explained that she felt insecure in school, which most of us can relate to, but her insecurities were mostly due to the fact that she didn't look like most of her friends. She had darker skin and features; everyone else was white and blonde. \n\nI was also totally blown away to hear that Shay used to dye her hair blonde and wear contacts in an effort to alter her image. She explains how she came to embrace herself, how she built up her confidence and told us an amazing quote her mother shared with her as a kid.

Conceived as an experimental, pavilion-style form in Los Angeles‚Äôs Sherman Oaks neighbourhood and designed by owners and architects Peggy Hsu and Chris McCullough, the experimental, Japanese-inspired house embraces its topography and provides a feeling of solitude in California. \n\nPeggy and Chris ‚Äì an avid collector ‚Äì were drawn to the site‚Äôs potential for an experimental, Japanese-inspired architecture. Peggy says, ‚Äúthe area is less densely populated on the hillside and most properties have deep backyards. Ours frames an uninterrupted view of Fossil Ridge Park ‚Äì it can never be developed and there are no homes, just a natural landscape featuring hillside oak trees and unique wildlife.‚Äù \n\nThe interior design of this Japanese-inspired house features a textural materiality, and plants blur the boundaries between inside and out. Inside, texture, art and materiality converge in a layered interior. An architect‚Äôs own home can often lead to experimental and deeply personal design outcomes ‚Äì a sentiment that rings true in this house. The kitchen sits beneath a picture window that captures western sun and provides sightlines to the street. Given its proximity to the living room, its aesthetic relationship to the rest of the home was an important experimental consideration. As such, Peggy and Chris looked to Fisher & Paykel for appliances, tapping into the company‚Äôs integration capabilities and refined aesthetic to match their experimental vision. \n\nThe Column Refrigerator and Freezer are integrated into the kitchen cabinetry, the black glass induction cooktop complements the charcoal joinery, and the Downdraft Range Hood allows for considerable flexibility. ‚ÄúFisher & Paykel helped us specify this retractable exhaust, which sits behind the induction cooktop so when it‚Äôs not in use, it disappears into the counter space,‚Äù Peggy shares. \n\nAs an architect‚Äôs own home, Ridge Residence‚Äôs tactility and experimental undertone result in a meaningful architectural expression. As the timber silvers and the roof gardens grow, this home will be enveloped by its environment, melding into the hillside upon which is sits. \n\n00:00 - Introduction to the Experimental Japanese-Inspired Home\n00:54 - The Private Location\n01:14 - External Materials\n01:36 - An Original 1960's Home\n01:52 - The Functional and Balanced Design of the Kitchen\n02:50 - The Internal Material Palette\n03:48 - Integrating Japanese Wet Rooms\n04:06 - Showcasing Collections\n04:41 - Working with Dark and Brawny Materiality\n\nFor more from The Local Project: \n\nInstagram ‚Äì https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/ \nWebsite ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/ \nPrint Publication ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/ \nHardcover Book ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/book/ \nThe Local Project Marketplace ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/ \n\nTo subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/ \n\nArchitecture, Design, Interior Design, Styling and Landscape Design by Hsu McCullough.\nPhotography by Mike Kelley and Joe Fletcher.\nBuild by Dynamic Builders of Southern California.\nStructural Engineering by Parker Resnick Structural Engineering.\nGeotechnical Engineering by Ralph Stone and Company.\nAppliances by Fisher & Paykel.\nFilmed and Edited by The Local Project.\nProduction by The Local Project.\n-\nLocation: Sherman Oaks, CA, Unites States\n\nThe Local Project acknowledges the traditional territories and homelands of the Indigenous peoples in the United States.

Sitting on the edge of a forest, Aktis Architects works alongside the challenges presented by the site and a linear arrangement of spaces, creating an equally robust yet elegant farm home that connects and contrasts the quintessential Australian landscape it sits within. Built for the Director of Lexicon Constructions, the brief called for a mid-century modern family house that was linear in form and worked to encapsulate a strong sense of togetherness.\n \nApproaching the mid-century modern home, one is met with a modest elevation composed of two raking roofs, each perched above a masonry box. A gravel driveway meanders through dense planting to arrive at a porte coch√®re lined with vertical timber cladding. The house tour reveals a linear arrangement of spaces inside, so the need for circulation areas and corridors is redundant. The concrete frame structure is defined by a geometric architecture, whilst circular windows contrast the geometry of the home and add a sense of playfulness.\n \nThe outdoors becomes part of the interior design of the home. Rooms are built to flow into each other, and the natural surrounds maintain a constant presence in the home‚Äôs interior, thanks to a continuous glass wall. Landscaping is equally considered, with native plants dominating and complementing the timber fa√ßade. Whilst being south-facing, northern lighting enters the home through skylights, a courtyard and shadows from the pool, whilst the south-facing light gives a beautiful orange glow.\n \nIn line with its mid-century modern approach, Merricks House is comprised of raw materiality, a pared-back palette with minimal decor and applied finishes throughout. Inside, there is a distinct lack of plastered or painted finishing, and timber is used generously for wall linings and kitchen and bedroom joinery in juxtaposition to the burnished concrete floors. The simple detailing and preference for natural materials imbue the home with a warm, cosy feeling.\n \nA mid-century modern home that is captivating and immersive, Merricks House presents confident architecture. The home harnesses the benefits of its site and landscape whilst maintaining a sense of wonder in its monumental scale.\n \n00:00 - Introduction to the Mid-Century Modern House\n00:45 - The Perks of Building Your Own Home\n01:29 - A Rural Area\n01:53 - A Simple Family Focused Brief\n02:30 - A Walkthrough of the Home and the Elements\n03:32 - Bringing the Outside In\n04:04 - Compromising on Light\n05:04 - Simple and Well-Thought Out Details\n05:47 - Caring for the Landscape\n06:39 - A Successful Outcome\n \nFor more from The Local Project:\n \nInstagram ‚Äì https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/\nWebsite ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/\nPrint Publication ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/\nHardcover Book ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/book/\nThe Local Project Marketplace ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/\n \nTo subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/\n \nPhotography by Timothy Kaye.\nArchitecture by Aktis Architects.\nBuild by Lexicon Constructions.\nLandscape by Acre.\nEngineering by Meyer Consulting.\nJoinery by Paul Pace Cabinets.\nFilmed by The Local Project.\nEdited by Selina Miles.\nProduction by The Local Project.\n\nLocation: Merricks, Victoria, Australia\n \nThe Local Project acknowledges the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land in Australia.

An integral link between land and sea, mangroves protect coastal areas and communities from hurricanes, tsunamis, flooding and erosion, while providing a multitude of goods and ecosystem services for people. Mangroves act as huge carbon stores, often storing 5x more than inland rainforests, and are amongst the world‚Äôs most productive fishing grounds. Mangroves are disappearing at an alarming rate and these unique and critical ecosystems need protecting and restoring. \n\nSince 1992, the Mangrove Action Project (MAP) has worked to educate the public about mangrove forests, to promote and engage in mangrove conservation and restoration. Our mission is to provide mangrove restoration and conservation education, training, and consulting that promotes community- based, sustainable management of coastal resources. \n\nMAP is dedicated to reversing the degradation and loss of mangrove forests. These critical coastal ecosystems linking land and sea, play a vital role in helping to keep our planet and people healthy. Although now regarded as one of the most important ecosystems, mangrove forests are among the most threatened habitats in the world, and mangrove loss is rampant across the globe. By some estimates, less than 50 percent of the world‚Äôs mangrove forests were intact at the end of the 20th century.\nBy demonstrating the importance of mangrove forests through our programs, we are striving for a protected and restored coastline managed sustainably by local communities. \n\nFind out more about the Mangrove Action Project - http://mangroveactionproject.org\n\nAnd subscribe for all mangrove news and updates -\nhttp://mangroveactionproject.org/subscribe-to-map-news/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 303, "publish_time": "20130906"}

Creating a piece of architecture that was befitting of the location and striking natural landscape, Vitrocsa collaborated with Joe Adsett Architects to produce the concrete super house that fully embraced its location. Balancing at the very top of the site, the concrete super house offers views from East of Brisbane toward Picnic Point and Table Top Mountain.\n\nWhilst the home‚Äôs location is situated over a ridge, Joe Adsett Architects endeavoured to create more space by cantilevering away from the slope. By projecting part of the concrete super house out from the built space, the ability to create a more functional living space with privacy from surrounding neighbours arose. \n\nArriving at the concrete super house, the gaze is immediately ensnared by the curving concrete wall that cantilevers away from the base of the home. With the garage underneath the house offering one way of entrance, it is the curved pathway leading to the deliberately oversized glass pivot door that is the striking entrance of the home. Working with Vitrocsa to create the glazing for the home, the frame of the windows was done with a slender aluminium product comprised of reinforced stainless steel. Made in Australia and designed to Swiss specifications, the framing offers unbroken views of the surrounding landscape whilst also bringing a seamless indoor-outdoor flow into the home.\n\nWith restrained materials used across the exterior architecture, the interior design choices also reflect the primary theme of the concrete super house. Softened with veneered timber products and large porcelain tiles, curves and sharp points are repeated through the joinery elements. Furthermore, the furnishings also introduce soft textures and colours that bring a humanising element to the concrete super house.  \n\n00:00 - A Welcome to Cliffhanger House \n00:36 - The Location of the Super House \n00:46 - Building On The Edge of A Landslide Zone\n01:36 - Arriving At The Site\n02:00 - The Vitrocsa Glazing Suite\n02:40 - A Seamless Flow From Kitchen to Outdoors\n03:00 - An Extension of The Main Living Area\n03:14 - The Material Palette\n03:52 - Emulating The Architecture Through Furniture\n04:17 - Designing Weather Flexible Houses\n04:41 - The Challenging Aspect of The Cantilever\n\nFor more from The Local Project: \n\nInstagram ‚Äì https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/ \nWebsite ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/ \nPrint Publication ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/ \nThe Local Project Marketplace ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/ \n\nTo subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here ‚Äì https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/ \n\nPhotography by Cam Murchison.\nArchitecture by Joe Adsett Architects. \nBuild by Valdal Projects. \nEngineering by Westera Partners. \nWindows by Vitrocsa. \nFurniture by Space. \nFilmed and Edited by Dan Preston. \nProduction by The Local Project.\n\nThe Local Project Acknowledges the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land in Australia.

How to brake smoothly? Here are a few simple driving hacks and secrets you should know to drive your car like a pro.\nHave you already been driving for many years or are you just starting to drive? This activity can be both exciting and exhausting. Of course, firstly it depends on road conditions. However, there is one more important thing to be considered while driving ‚Äì the behavior of your car. The longer you own a¬†car; the more driving habits you acquire. Unfortunately, not all of¬†those habits are good ones. Moreover, the more experienced you become, the harder it¬†is¬†to¬†break them. And very often those habits can affect the condition of your car. We¬†decided to¬†compile examples of¬†unwise driving behavior. \n\nTIMESTAMPS\nResting your hand on¬†the gear stick 1:09\nRefueling only when the tank is¬†almost empty 2:13\nFrequent braking 3:04\nIgnoring suspicious sounds 4:26\nNeglecting to¬†use the hand brake 5:50\nRunning a¬†cold engine at¬†high revs 6:34\nKeeping your foot on¬†the brake while driving downhill 7:17\n\nSUMMARY\n- Whether you own an automatic or a manual car, a transmission that is not working correctly can cause serious problems both under the hood and out on the road. Moreover, transmissions are very complex, they have many moving parts, ignoring this bad habit can easily bring you to huge expenses for a transmission repair. \n- The dirt gets into the filters and the pump causing damage. The purpose of the latter is to get fuel from the fuel tank and deliver it according to the demand of the engine. During winter months, be¬†sure to¬†always leave the tank at¬†least half-filled with fuel to¬†avoid the formation of¬†large amounts of¬†condensate. \n- To¬†avoid unpleasant accidents, remember to¬†promptly change the brake hoses and keep your eye on¬†the brake fluid level. Keep in mind that braking is another skill to be mastered; it takes a certain skill level to do it correctly. \n- Please use the following steps to safely move your vehicle away from the highway and to avoid the possible danger. \nFirstly, pull over to a safe spot. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for any possible assistance because the process might not be that easy as it seems. And remember to switch on the hazard lights. If the car has completely broken down and you cannot start it, just push it to a safe place After, try to diagnose the issue.\n- To¬†successfully park on¬†an¬†incline, hold the foot brake and shift into \"park.\" Then pull the hand brake, and only then slowly release the brake. It doesn‚Äôt really matter if your car has a manual or an automatic transmission, car manufacturers recommend the use of the parking brake to immobilize any parked vehicle. \n- Most modern engines don‚Äôt need warming¬†up. However, it¬†is¬†worth remembering that until the gauge indicates operating temperature one shouldn‚Äôt run the engine at¬†more than 2,000¬†revs. In¬†freezing conditions, it¬†is¬†advisable to¬†keep the engine running for 1-2 minutes before pulling away. \n- The proper thing to¬†do¬†is¬†to¬†shift to¬†a¬†lower gear and initiate engine braking, which helps to reduce the use of normal brakes. It works by reducing the speed of the engine, which means that the speed of the vehicle reduces too. The aim is to prevent the vehicle get a too fast speed, especially while going downhill. \n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC¬†\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.brightside.me/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 536, "publish_time": "20170924"}
