She's answering common facial-filler questions and performing full-face rejuvenations on two of her clients. Filler is a volume inducer, mostly made out of hyaluronic acid, that helps add volume to areas that are shifting downwards because of aging. Common areas patients request are the eyes, cheeks, and lips. However, fillers can also be placed on the chin, jawline, and around the nose. \n\nClients can see a difference immediately after receiving filler, but fully healed results show in about two weeks. One syringe of filler typically costs about $500 to $1,000, and results can last a year to two years. If someone is doing a full facial lift with fillers, such as a combination of the under eyes, cheeks, lips, nasolabial folds, and jawline, that can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $10,000, and those results can last three to four years. If a client isn't happy with their results, hyaluronic acid fillers can be completely dissolved. It's important to visit a professional who will understand your face shape, ethnicity, mental and physical health concerns, and what to do if a treatment has complications.\n\nFor more, please visit Vanessa Lee:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/vanessalee_rn/\nThe Things We Do:\nhttps://thethingswedo.co/. \n\nMORE BEAUTY INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Medical Pedicures Transform Feet\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHuvDvCkbC0&t=13s\n11 Grossly Satisfying Beauty Treatments For Better Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pdzwgKFHI\nHow A Nonsurgical Face-Lift Works | Beauty Explorers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot_2tuwRR2U\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Fillers #BeautyTransformations #BeautyInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

The desire for community and purpose will always find a way even if it's in the form of a summer work program. It is even more powerful when paired with the poetry of passionate teens.  \n\nDenise Fellows, prior to SummerWorks, referred to herself as a ‚Äúsilent poet.‚Äù She said that her poetry used to ‚Äòscream so loud to be heard by someone other than her own ears.‚Äô Denise worked with SummerWorks in the summer of 2014, and it was there she began sharing her work.\n\nKira Cobbs was born in 1998 in Denver, CO. She plays the piano and practices Chinese and sign language; she also participates in her school‚Äôs poetry organization, Louder Than a Bomb. She has been writing poetry since she was inspired to do so by her fourth grade teacher.

It was an amazing experience and opportunity.‚Äù \r\n\r\nJasmine would like to thank her 7th grade teacher, Ms. Carlson of Monroe Middle School, for introducing her to poetry. Jasmine says poetry is the reasons she is the person she is today; it has helped her through anger, depression, and other life struggles.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The results were compared with those obtained in men during continuous sleep. Although mean levels and area under the curve of testosterone were similar in both groups, fragmented sleep resulted in a significant delay in testosterone rise (03:24 h ¬± 1:13 vs. 22:35 h ¬± 0:22)\nDuring fragmented sleep, nocturnal testosterone rise was observed only in subjects who showed REM episodes (4/10) - findings indicate that the sleep-related rise in serum testosterone levels is linked with the appearance of first REM sleep. The rise in testosterone levels was slower when REM latency was longer in young adult men, testosterone levels begin to rise on falling asleep, peak at about the time of first REM, and remain at the same levels until awakening.\n\nMorning vs Evening Workouts Study - Study - journal PLoS One:\nLooked at the effect of time of day on performance, hormonal and metabolic response during a 1000-M cycling time trial in 9 recreational cyclists, average age 31. The participants performed a 1000-m TT at either 8 am or 6 pm, in randomized, repeated-measures, crossover design a 1000-m cycling time-trial. The time to complete the time trial was lower in the evening than in the morning (88.2 vs 94.7, respectively), but there was no significant different in pacing. However, oxygen uptake and aerobic mechanical power output at 600 and 1000 m tended to be higher in the evening. There was also a main effect of time of day for insulin, cortisol, and total and free testosterone concentration, which were all higher in the morning (+60%, +26%, +31% and +22%, respectively) The norepinephrine response to the exercise was increased in the morning (+46%), and it was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in the response of glucose.\n\nReferences:\n\n1) The Effect of Diurnal Variation on Clinical Measurement of Serum Testosterone and Other Sex Hormone Levels in Men.

They can also help with asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Purchase a high altitude training mask here: https://amzn.to/2VWcevd (affiliate link) NOTE: This is not the unit I used in the video. That one is no longer available.\n\nThese types of breathing exercises can give improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance and exercise performance. \n\nInspiratory muscle training is basically a series of breathing exercises that aim to strengthen the bodies‚Äô respiratory muscles making it easier for people to breathe. When a person is breathing normally, they typically use between 10 to 15 per cent of his or her total lung capacity. However, with Inspiratory muscle training, a person can typically increase the amount of lung capacity used. \n\nA tool that can help with inspiratory muscle training is a high altitude training mask like the one from Perpetual Air featured in the video. These masks restrict air flow and can help with inspiratory muscle training. The Perpetual Air mask has various levels of air restriction that are easily adjusted.\n\nThe following exercises can be done either with our without a high altitude training mask.\n\nThe first breathing exercise is very simple. Breath in through your nose for 2 seconds and breath out through your mouth with pursed lips for 4 seconds. \n\nNow you are going to move your arms with the breathing to loosen up the muscles around your chest area. \n\nFinally, breathing with your diaphragm, or belly breathing, is a great way to relax and improve your breathing.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nBreathing Exercises for Relaxation or COPD:\nhttps://youtu.be/-7-CAFhJn78\n\n===========================================\n\nSUPPORT me on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo\n\n===========================================\n\nBreathing Exercises for COPD, Asthma, Bronchitis & Emphysema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpTNUGwXbTU\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.

Some MCU actors like Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd were far from ripped and muscular when they were cast in their respective roles. However, they put in the work to attain the fit and athletic bodies they sport on screen. This is no easy feat, as getting your body into peak shape is an incredibly difficult task. Sometimes it take‚Äôs over a year of strict dieting and workout plans to achieve their goals. And then years more maintaining this shape for future movies in the MCU. Luckily for them, they are provided with top of the line trainers and dieticians that help them along their journey. This definitely helps, but it‚Äôs still on the actors to apply themselves to the regimes assigned. Which actors had difficulties maintaining their diets?\nSometimes the trainers used by these actors are actually good friends with them, as is the case with Chris Hemsworth, who has known his trainer since he was four years old.\n\nAll those muscles aren‚Äôt just for show, and these actors have done some seriously impressive things.

As we get older, our testosterone tends to naturally decline. We can‚Äôt stop it completely, but we can fight back against the loss of our needed male hormones. Having less fat and more muscle is crucial for our testosterone production. When you think of building muscle, you think of resistance training and lifting weights at the gym or at home. While that is the major key for building muscle, there are some needs you need to fo to help optimize muscle growth.\n\nAside from resistance training, there are 2 more major keys for building muscle faster after 50. Recovery and getting good quality sleep is another crucial part for building muscle. That is the time when your body works on repairing the muscle fibers you damage from your workouts, helping them grow bigger during the recovery. \n\nThe last major component is nutrition. In order to build more muscle, you need to make sure that you are consuming enough protein. Protein is the most needed food group in order to build more muscle during your recovery from your workouts. There are a lot of foods you can eat, supplements you can, protein powder you can drink to get protein in your body. That is why I am going to give you 5 great foods that you can eat to help you build more muscle faster after 50.\n\nHere are the 5 foods to help you build muscle faster after 50.

Or in other words, simply figuring out how you‚Äôre going to group your exercises throughout the week. And although there isn‚Äôt one ‚Äúbest workout split‚Äù for everyone, certain muscle building splits have their advantages. For example, we know that training a muscle at least 2x/week is superior to 1x/week. This automatically makes the common bro split inferior to other higher muscle training frequency workout splits. Training splits like the upper lower split, full body workout splits (‚Äútotal body workouts‚Äù), and the push pull legs workout split train each muscle 2x/week whereas the bro split does not. This not only helps better optimize protein synthesis but also enables you to get more quality sets done since your workout volume is spread out over multiple workouts.\n\nBut which of these splits should you choose for mass? Well, it depends on your training experience. The best workout split for beginners looking to put on mass is likely a 3 day workout split with full body workouts. This is because you can train the compound lifts frequently and master them very quickly without causing too much muscle damage. Then, as you gain experience and need more volume to progress, you can switch to a 4 day workout split (such as the upper/lower split) to help spread out your volume better throughout the week. And then, as you progress even more, switching to a 5 day workout split or a 6 day workout split (push pull legs for example) would be wise to keep your workouts from being excessively long and fatiguing. However, despite what research says, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that workout volume and consistency are the more important factors. So choose the workout split that you enjoy the most and best fits your schedule ‚Äì as that‚Äôs going to be the best option for you! \n\nAnd if you‚Äôre looking for a step-by-step program that shows you how to optimize your training and nutrition in order to progress as efficiently as possible, then simply take my starting-point analysis tool below to find which program is best for you: \nhttps://builtwithscience.com/bws-free-fitness-quiz/gender?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=Video&utm_content=Description%20box&utm_campaign=Science%20based%20back%20split%20to%20maximize%20growth%20Jan%206%2F2019\n\nLINK TO WRITTEN ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/best-workout-split/ \n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM & FACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeremyethier/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Jeremyethierfit/\n\nMUSIC:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\nSTUDIES:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729395\n\nOTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES:\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/frequency-muscle/\nhttps://mennohenselmans.com/optimal-program-design/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 427, "publish_time": "20190106"}

Doctor Wagner explains pre-workout supplements, best pre workout supplement, preworkout, pre-workout meal, pre-workout drink, pre-workout powder, how to take pre-workout, strongest pre-workout, homemade pre-work, and how to properly use it to boost performance, and more in this pre-workout review. Is choosing the best workout supplements the answer to how to build muscle fast and lose belly fat? Is pre-workout bad for you? Is it safe to take pre workout everyday? Questions about pre-workout backed by science are answered by a real doctor. Pre-workout supplements or pre-workouts are multi-ingredient dietary formulas designed to boost energy and athletic performance. They‚Äôre typically a powdered substance that you mix in water and drink before exercise. Ingredients typically will include amino acids BCAAs, B vitamins, caffeine, creatine, nitric oxide precursors, L-arginine, L-citrulline, and artificial sweeteners are often included. Have you pre-workouts such as C4 or any other brands? What has your pre-workout experience been?

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nThe success of Joker and Venom has completely changed the way movie studios are looking at superhero movies. No longer are our caped heroes standing front and center. With Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad coming soon, we could see a whole slate of super-villain movies hitting the big screen. Why bother trying another stab at remaking the Fantastic Four when there‚Äôs such a better character to focus on instead? Doctor Doom stood in the shadows of both Fantastic Four franchises, serving as the main villain, but not getting fleshed out enough to truly becoming a compelling part of the films. Catwoman had her shot at a solo movie with Halle Berry‚Äôs disappointing cheesefest back in 2004, but there‚Äôs another DC vixen who could really shine with a solo story -- and her name is Poison Ivy. Just the thought of Poison Ivy on the big screen has probably conjured some pretty bad memories of Batman and Robin, but let‚Äôs just pull that withered weed from the garden and start over. Despite the cheesy puns about ice, snow, and everything frozen, you cannot deny the dramatic possibilities of the Mr. Freeze origin story we saw glimpses of in the 1997 disaster Batman & Robin. Arnold Schawnegger‚Äôs portrayal of Mr. Freeze is pretty much a big joke now and has resulted in no other portrayals of the character on the big-screen, but he definitely has a great story to tell. \n\nThe Joker did a deep dive into the character‚Äôs psyche, backstory, and provided a whole new perspective on the madness behind him. But what other villains deserve a similar movie treatment? Between some Marvel juggernauts and DC villains who deserve proper big-screen treatment, let‚Äôs see who should go solo in the future!\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 635, "publish_time": "20191024"}

Initially I was a little apprehensive, worried that my drawing skills might have deteriorated during my time away.\n\nBut as I mention in the video, to my surprise they‚Äôd actually improved! I‚Äôm not sure what the exact reason behind this is, but I suspect that after getting some distance my brain had time to process everything I‚Äôd learned. So when I eventually started drawing again, it was all still there!\n\nI do feel like my work has a bit more rhythm to it now, which feels great. I‚Äôm not thinking about it, or judging it as much anymore. I‚Äôm not too concerned about the small things. The creation process seems to have become quite fluid for me as of recently and I‚Äôm thankful for that.\n\nThe idea for this character design sketch came about after I‚Äôd spent long enough thinking about an idea that had been fermenting inside my mind for the last few months. It was an idea for a comic book, and the more I thought about it, the more complete it became.\n\nEventually I‚Äôd somehow worked out an entire plot in my head without writing anything down at all, and at that point I figured hey, why not put pencil to paper and see if I can‚Äôt come up with a few cool character concepts for this story?\n\nThe character in this video is one of the key players in the plot. He works at a robotics plant where he manufactures bio mechanical replacement bodies for people to transfer their consciousness to when their organic bodies become obsolete. \n\nThe catch is that these body replacements, otherwise known as capsules, are reserved only for the wealthy and the powerful. \nSo of course this character, being a mere engineer at a manufacturing plant would never be able get his hands on one of these bio mechanical bodies, which is unfortunate for him because it just so happens that his younger brother is terminally ill with a rare disease that can‚Äôt be cured. \n\nHowever, he loves his brother and would do anything to save him ‚Äì so he does the unthinkable, illegally uploading his brothers consciousness into a capsule which does not belong to him.\n\nIn fact, this capsule has been set aside and belongs to one of the most powerful and feared gangsters in the entire city. And that‚Äôs just the beginning of the story! But I‚Äôll leave it there for now. I don‚Äôt want to give away too much just yet ‚Äì especially because I have no idea when I‚Äôll get round to actually putting this comic together!\n\nI hope you enjoy the video! \n\nThanks for watching! \n-Clayton\n\nSoftware Used: Manga Studio\n\nIf you like the video, show your support by commenting, sharing or subscribing. \n\nComic Art Community - https://www.howtodrawcomics.net/comic-art-community/\nHow to Draw Comics .NET - http://www.howtodrawcomics.net/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/howtodrawcomics/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/howtodrawcomics\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/howtodrawcomics\nTumblr - http://howtodrawcomics.tumblr.com/\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/howtodrawcomics/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1271, "publish_time": "20190409"}

Strangely satisfying", "description": "Chill out for 10 mins and let us do the work.\n\nI use timelapse filming mainly to prove to myself that at the end of the day I have actually done some work! Most of these shots cover several hours of digging condensed into just a matter of seconds- but when you're in the woods digging, especially if you're alone, progress can seem painfully slow sometimes! Making a big landing takes so much effort, the volume of dirt alone can mean hundreds, maybe thousands of wheelbarrows to fill, move and empty. \n\nI find that filming a timelapse stops me from getting lazy - if I stop digging to call or message someone it looks very obvious in the shot. You have to keep busy and keep moving. It's a good way of making sure you don't stop until the job is done. I generally set myself a target of something to achieve and then don't go home until it's done- even if it means getting lights out of my car and digging into the night. \n\nThis video is a mash-up of some of the timelapses I have shot over the last few years either of me alone (cheeky week day visits) or with the crew all digging together on Sunday. Even tho we're hopefully nearing the point when we can all return to our local trail spots- it's been weeks since I have ridden or done any digging. I plan to ease myself back into things and spend more time on a shovel than a bike for a while. \n\nReally hope you enjoy the video... Next week's video is a little different from the norm so look out for that one!\n\nTake it easy - oh yeah and subscribe ;-)", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 545, "publish_time": "20200515"}

You may use any brand you like but, most importantly for this technique, use 100% cotton. \n\nBrushes: I use a variety of brushes by different brands: Silver Brush, Chinese calligraphy brushes from Blue Heron Art and Michael Solovyev, squirrel brushes by Roubleff, synthetic by Escoda and Etchr, Aliexpress, and a few other different brands.

She's answering common facial-filler questions and performing full-face rejuvenations on two of her clients. Filler is a volume inducer, mostly made out of hyaluronic acid, that helps add volume to areas that are shifting downwards because of aging. Common areas patients request are the eyes, cheeks, and lips. However, fillers can also be placed on the chin, jawline, and around the nose. \n\nClients can see a difference immediately after receiving filler, but fully healed results show in about two weeks. One syringe of filler typically costs about $500 to $1,000, and results can last a year to two years. If someone is doing a full facial lift with fillers, such as a combination of the under eyes, cheeks, lips, nasolabial folds, and jawline, that can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $10,000, and those results can last three to four years. If a client isn't happy with their results, hyaluronic acid fillers can be completely dissolved. It's important to visit a professional who will understand your face shape, ethnicity, mental and physical health concerns, and what to do if a treatment has complications.\n\nFor more, please visit Vanessa Lee:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/vanessalee_rn/\nThe Things We Do:\nhttps://thethingswedo.co/. \n\nMORE BEAUTY INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Medical Pedicures Transform Feet\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHuvDvCkbC0&t=13s\n11 Grossly Satisfying Beauty Treatments For Better Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pdzwgKFHI\nHow A Nonsurgical Face-Lift Works | Beauty Explorers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot_2tuwRR2U\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Fillers #BeautyTransformations #BeautyInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

The results were compared with those obtained in men during continuous sleep. Although mean levels and area under the curve of testosterone were similar in both groups, fragmented sleep resulted in a significant delay in testosterone rise (03:24 h ¬± 1:13 vs. 22:35 h ¬± 0:22)\nDuring fragmented sleep, nocturnal testosterone rise was observed only in subjects who showed REM episodes (4/10) - findings indicate that the sleep-related rise in serum testosterone levels is linked with the appearance of first REM sleep. The rise in testosterone levels was slower when REM latency was longer in young adult men, testosterone levels begin to rise on falling asleep, peak at about the time of first REM, and remain at the same levels until awakening.\n\nMorning vs Evening Workouts Study - Study - journal PLoS One:\nLooked at the effect of time of day on performance, hormonal and metabolic response during a 1000-M cycling time trial in 9 recreational cyclists, average age 31. The participants performed a 1000-m TT at either 8 am or 6 pm, in randomized, repeated-measures, crossover design a 1000-m cycling time-trial. The time to complete the time trial was lower in the evening than in the morning (88.2 vs 94.7, respectively), but there was no significant different in pacing. However, oxygen uptake and aerobic mechanical power output at 600 and 1000 m tended to be higher in the evening. There was also a main effect of time of day for insulin, cortisol, and total and free testosterone concentration, which were all higher in the morning (+60%, +26%, +31% and +22%, respectively) The norepinephrine response to the exercise was increased in the morning (+46%), and it was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in the response of glucose.\n\nReferences:\n\n1) The Effect of Diurnal Variation on Clinical Measurement of Serum Testosterone and Other Sex Hormone Levels in Men.

They can also help with asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Purchase a high altitude training mask here: https://amzn.to/2VWcevd (affiliate link) NOTE: This is not the unit I used in the video. That one is no longer available.\n\nThese types of breathing exercises can give improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance and exercise performance. \n\nInspiratory muscle training is basically a series of breathing exercises that aim to strengthen the bodies‚Äô respiratory muscles making it easier for people to breathe. When a person is breathing normally, they typically use between 10 to 15 per cent of his or her total lung capacity. However, with Inspiratory muscle training, a person can typically increase the amount of lung capacity used. \n\nA tool that can help with inspiratory muscle training is a high altitude training mask like the one from Perpetual Air featured in the video. These masks restrict air flow and can help with inspiratory muscle training. The Perpetual Air mask has various levels of air restriction that are easily adjusted.\n\nThe following exercises can be done either with our without a high altitude training mask.\n\nThe first breathing exercise is very simple. Breath in through your nose for 2 seconds and breath out through your mouth with pursed lips for 4 seconds. \n\nNow you are going to move your arms with the breathing to loosen up the muscles around your chest area. \n\nFinally, breathing with your diaphragm, or belly breathing, is a great way to relax and improve your breathing.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nBreathing Exercises for Relaxation or COPD:\nhttps://youtu.be/-7-CAFhJn78\n\n===========================================\n\nSUPPORT me on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo\n\n===========================================\n\nBreathing Exercises for COPD, Asthma, Bronchitis & Emphysema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpTNUGwXbTU\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.

Some MCU actors like Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd were far from ripped and muscular when they were cast in their respective roles. However, they put in the work to attain the fit and athletic bodies they sport on screen. This is no easy feat, as getting your body into peak shape is an incredibly difficult task. Sometimes it take‚Äôs over a year of strict dieting and workout plans to achieve their goals. And then years more maintaining this shape for future movies in the MCU. Luckily for them, they are provided with top of the line trainers and dieticians that help them along their journey. This definitely helps, but it‚Äôs still on the actors to apply themselves to the regimes assigned. Which actors had difficulties maintaining their diets?\nSometimes the trainers used by these actors are actually good friends with them, as is the case with Chris Hemsworth, who has known his trainer since he was four years old.\n\nAll those muscles aren‚Äôt just for show, and these actors have done some seriously impressive things. One of the Marvel stars can now push a 5,000 pound jeep.

As we get older, our testosterone tends to naturally decline. We can‚Äôt stop it completely, but we can fight back against the loss of our needed male hormones. Having less fat and more muscle is crucial for our testosterone production. When you think of building muscle, you think of resistance training and lifting weights at the gym or at home. While that is the major key for building muscle, there are some needs you need to fo to help optimize muscle growth.\n\nAside from resistance training, there are 2 more major keys for building muscle faster after 50. Recovery and getting good quality sleep is another crucial part for building muscle. That is the time when your body works on repairing the muscle fibers you damage from your workouts, helping them grow bigger during the recovery. \n\nThe last major component is nutrition. In order to build more muscle, you need to make sure that you are consuming enough protein. Protein is the most needed food group in order to build more muscle during your recovery from your workouts. There are a lot of foods you can eat, supplements you can, protein powder you can drink to get protein in your body.

Or in other words, simply figuring out how you‚Äôre going to group your exercises throughout the week. And although there isn‚Äôt one ‚Äúbest workout split‚Äù for everyone, certain muscle building splits have their advantages. For example, we know that training a muscle at least 2x/week is superior to 1x/week. This automatically makes the common bro split inferior to other higher muscle training frequency workout splits. Training splits like the upper lower split, full body workout splits (‚Äútotal body workouts‚Äù), and the push pull legs workout split train each muscle 2x/week whereas the bro split does not. This not only helps better optimize protein synthesis but also enables you to get more quality sets done since your workout volume is spread out over multiple workouts.\n\nBut which of these splits should you choose for mass? Well, it depends on your training experience. The best workout split for beginners looking to put on mass is likely a 3 day workout split with full body workouts. This is because you can train the compound lifts frequently and master them very quickly without causing too much muscle damage. Then, as you gain experience and need more volume to progress, you can switch to a 4 day workout split (such as the upper/lower split) to help spread out your volume better throughout the week. And then, as you progress even more, switching to a 5 day workout split or a 6 day workout split (push pull legs for example) would be wise to keep your workouts from being excessively long and fatiguing. However, despite what research says, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that workout volume and consistency are the more important factors. So choose the workout split that you enjoy the most and best fits your schedule ‚Äì as that‚Äôs going to be the best option for you! \n\nAnd if you‚Äôre looking for a step-by-step program that shows you how to optimize your training and nutrition in order to progress as efficiently as possible, then simply take my starting-point analysis tool below to find which program is best for you: \nhttps://builtwithscience.com/bws-free-fitness-quiz/gender?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=Video&utm_content=Description%20box&utm_campaign=Science%20based%20back%20split%20to%20maximize%20growth%20Jan%206%2F2019\n\nLINK TO WRITTEN ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/best-workout-split/ \n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM & FACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeremyethier/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Jeremyethierfit/\n\nMUSIC:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\nSTUDIES:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729395\n\nOTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES:\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/frequency-muscle/\nhttps://mennohenselmans.com/optimal-program-design/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 427, "publish_time": "20190106"}

Questions about pre-workout backed by science are answered by a real doctor.

They‚Äôre typically a powdered substance that you mix in water and drink before exercise. Ingredients typically will include amino acids BCAAs, B vitamins, caffeine, creatine, nitric oxide precursors, L-arginine, L-citrulline, and artificial sweeteners are often included.

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nThe success of Joker and Venom has completely changed the way movie studios are looking at superhero movies. No longer are our caped heroes standing front and center. With Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad coming soon, we could see a whole slate of super-villain movies hitting the big screen. Why bother trying another stab at remaking the Fantastic Four when there‚Äôs such a better character to focus on instead? Doctor Doom stood in the shadows of both Fantastic Four franchises, serving as the main villain, but not getting fleshed out enough to truly becoming a compelling part of the films. Catwoman had her shot at a solo movie with Halle Berry‚Äôs disappointing cheesefest back in 2004, but there‚Äôs another DC vixen who could really shine with a solo story -- and her name is Poison Ivy. Just the thought of Poison Ivy on the big screen has probably conjured some pretty bad memories of Batman and Robin, but let‚Äôs just pull that withered weed from the garden and start over. Despite the cheesy puns about ice, snow, and everything frozen, you cannot deny the dramatic possibilities of the Mr. Freeze origin story we saw glimpses of in the 1997 disaster Batman & Robin. Arnold Schawnegger‚Äôs portrayal of Mr. Freeze is pretty much a big joke now and has resulted in no other portrayals of the character on the big-screen, but he definitely has a great story to tell. \n\nThe Joker did a deep dive into the character‚Äôs psyche, backstory, and provided a whole new perspective on the madness behind him. But what other villains deserve a similar movie treatment? Between some Marvel juggernauts and DC villains who deserve proper big-screen treatment, let‚Äôs see who should go solo in the future!\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 635, "publish_time": "20191024"}

Initially I was a little apprehensive, worried that my drawing skills might have deteriorated during my time away.\n\nBut as I mention in the video, to my surprise they‚Äôd actually improved! I‚Äôm not sure what the exact reason behind this is, but I suspect that after getting some distance my brain had time to process everything I‚Äôd learned. So when I eventually started drawing again, it was all still there!\n\nI do feel like my work has a bit more rhythm to it now, which feels great. I‚Äôm not thinking about it, or judging it as much anymore. I‚Äôm not too concerned about the small things. The creation process seems to have become quite fluid for me as of recently and I‚Äôm thankful for that.\n\nThe idea for this character design sketch came about after I‚Äôd spent long enough thinking about an idea that had been fermenting inside my mind for the last few months. It was an idea for a comic book, and the more I thought about it, the more complete it became.\n\nEventually I‚Äôd somehow worked out an entire plot in my head without writing anything down at all, and at that point I figured hey, why not put pencil to paper and see if I can‚Äôt come up with a few cool character concepts for this story?\n\nThe character in this video is one of the key players in the plot. He works at a robotics plant where he manufactures bio mechanical replacement bodies for people to transfer their consciousness to when their organic bodies become obsolete. \n\nThe catch is that these body replacements, otherwise known as capsules, are reserved only for the wealthy and the powerful. \nSo of course this character, being a mere engineer at a manufacturing plant would never be able get his hands on one of these bio mechanical bodies, which is unfortunate for him because it just so happens that his younger brother is terminally ill with a rare disease that can‚Äôt be cured. \n\nHowever, he loves his brother and would do anything to save him ‚Äì so he does the unthinkable, illegally uploading his brothers consciousness into a capsule which does not belong to him.\n\nIn fact, this capsule has been set aside and belongs to one of the most powerful and feared gangsters in the entire city. And that‚Äôs just the beginning of the story! But I‚Äôll leave it there for now. I don‚Äôt want to give away too much just yet ‚Äì especially because I have no idea when I‚Äôll get round to actually putting this comic together!\n\nI hope you enjoy the video! \n\nThanks for watching! \n-Clayton\n\nSoftware Used: Manga Studio\n\nIf you like the video, show your support by commenting, sharing or subscribing. \n\nComic Art Community - https://www.howtodrawcomics.net/comic-art-community/\nHow to Draw Comics .NET - http://www.howtodrawcomics.net/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/howtodrawcomics/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/howtodrawcomics\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/howtodrawcomics\nTumblr - http://howtodrawcomics.tumblr.com/\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/howtodrawcomics/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1271, "publish_time": "20190409"}

Strangely satisfying", "description": "Chill out for 10 mins and let us do the work.\n\nI use timelapse filming mainly to prove to myself that at the end of the day I have actually done some work! Most of these shots cover several hours of digging condensed into just a matter of seconds- but when you're in the woods digging, especially if you're alone, progress can seem painfully slow sometimes! Making a big landing takes so much effort, the volume of dirt alone can mean hundreds, maybe thousands of wheelbarrows to fill, move and empty. \n\nI find that filming a timelapse stops me from getting lazy - if I stop digging to call or message someone it looks very obvious in the shot. You have to keep busy and keep moving. It's a good way of making sure you don't stop until the job is done. I generally set myself a target of something to achieve and then don't go home until it's done- even if it means getting lights out of my car and digging into the night. \n\nThis video is a mash-up of some of the timelapses I have shot over the last few years either of me alone (cheeky week day visits) or with the crew all digging together on Sunday. Even tho we're hopefully nearing the point when we can all return to our local trail spots- it's been weeks since I have ridden or done any digging. I plan to ease myself back into things and spend more time on a shovel than a bike for a while. \n\nReally hope you enjoy the video... Next week's video is a little different from the norm so look out for that one!\n\nTake it easy - oh yeah and subscribe ;-)", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 545, "publish_time": "20200515"}

We are going to talk about composition in painting and learn a few techniques.\n\nColors used: Yellow Ochre, Olive Green, Quinacridone Sienna, Burnt Sienna, Cobalt Blue, Ultramarine Blue, Alizarin Crimson.\n\nPaint: I use a variety of watercolor paint brands (Daniel Smith, Holbein, M.Graham, Nevskaya Palitra). \n\nPaper: Arches, rough texture. You may use any brand you like but, most importantly for this technique, use 100% cotton. \n\nBrushes: I use a variety of brushes by different brands: Silver Brush, Chinese calligraphy brushes from Blue Heron Art and Michael Solovyev, squirrel brushes by Roubleff, synthetic by Escoda and Etchr, Aliexpress, and a few other different brands. I think it is helpful to buy good quality brushes but most important is the time you spend with that brush. \n\nMusic from YouTube's free music library.\n\nMy Etsy shop: https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/AlinaTulliArt\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/alinatulli/ \n\n#watercolortutorial #waterfallpainting #watercolorwaterfall #landscapetutorial #watercolorintermediate #aquarela #aquarelle #paintingtutorial #relaxingwatercolor #relaxingart", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 884, "publish_time": "20220428"}

After completing a two-year journey in our Airstream to see all 50 states and 51 National Parks, we left to travel abroad. We have downsized our possessions and sold our home so that we can wander about with only the things in our backpacks. \n\nWe love living on the road, traveling each week to a new location. We plan to travel extensively to every part of the world. Ours is not a slow travel lifestyle but rather a vagabondish one. The goal is not to check a country off a list, but to experience it by meeting new people, seeing how others live, and making new friends. We believe in laughing, loving, and living our lives to the fullest. \n\nWe are working hard to build a beautiful website where you can get travel information about the places we have been. In addition, we post blog articles to help you travel better. Our channel is a way of augmenting that effort, so sometimes we post videos about how to travel or a vlog showing our lives on the road as we do an activity or an adventure.

This is just the spot to cool off after a day on the beach. Laze around the pool, or move to the shaded deck upstairs and enjoy burgers fresh off the grill seated at the covered dining area. You can even watch your favorite sports channel on the outdoor TV.\n\nBe sure to turn the lights on around the pool at night and see how beautiful it is .\n\nThere are child protective gates on both levels of the house, so young children will not be able to access the pool area without an adult opening the gate.\n\nJumping and diving are not permitted and there should always be adult supervision when there are children in the pool.\n\nWhen the kids get tired of swimming in the pool they can move to the garage and play ping pong and fuss ball. You can open the garage door and then lower a screened door to allow for ventilation. And just in case the kids work up a thirst there is a small refrigerator there also. This is handy for the pool area too, so you don't have to go back to the house for cold drinks.\n\nThe outdoor shower with hot and cold water is just outside the garage - perfect for getting all the sand off before hitting the pool!\n\nThe kitchen is super well stocked and has everything you will need to prepare meals for your group. It has a breakfast bar with additional seating just in case there is not enough room for everyone round the dining table.\n\nThe 3 bedrooms consist of a king in the master bedroom with TV, large walk in closet and en suite bathroom.\n\nThe second bedroom has a queen bed and TV and the third bedroom is ideal for kids with a bunk bed with a single on top and a double below - and then there is even another bed that pulls out. The kids will love it! And they also have their own TV!\n\nThe den downstairs is comfy and cozy with an electric fireplace, 65 inch TV, games for the kids and there is also a queen sleeper sofa for those extra guests.\n\nThe third bathroom and laundry is also on this level and is convenient to the pool - no need to go all the way upstairs.\n\nOf course the house has ceiling fans in all rooms, wifi, pool toys and chairs for the beach with a buggy to transport them over. It literally takes about 3 minutes to walk from the house to the closest beach access - it is really no distance at all.\n\nThe house is dog friendly for most breeds with a 40 pound limit on size. You will have to show proof of vet prescribed flea medication and provide covers to protect furniture and bedding from pet hair.\n\nThree grocery stores are near by and the historic downtown is about 10 minutes by car, so the situation is ideal and this house really offers everything possible to make this your best vacation ever!", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 303, "publish_time": "20190627"}

Because while a lot of us are familiar with some of the more obvious effects in terms of our cardiovascular health and general fitness, there are some incredible, lesser-known benefits that make aerobic exercise an essential component of our overall health and wellness.\n\nAnd to give you some additional support in terms of incorporating more aerobic exercise into your routine this week, I‚Äôm also going to give you some quick and simple tips on routines and activities you can do to get started. Particularly ones that are very time efficient and effective.\n\nThe Top Health Benefits of Aerobic Exercise (0:44)\n\n#1 Helps Build a Stronger Immune System\n\nMost guys don‚Äôt know that consistent aerobic exercise is research-proven to keep your immune system strong and help your body ward off common illnesses like the flu or a cold.\n\n#2 Great Way to Burn Fat\n\nAerobics also increase your fat-burning capacity ‚Äì long after you‚Äôre done exercising: By regularly doing aerobic exercise, your muscles develop a higher number of mitochondria, which help you burn more fat at rest ‚Äì even when you‚Äôre not exercising.\n\n#3 Correlated with a Longer Lifespan\n\nAerobics help you live longer: According to the newest scientific research, those who engage in aerobic exercise live longer than those who do not.\n\n#4 Helps Improve Your Brain Function\n\nAerobics makes you smarter: New research also shows that aerobics increases your brain‚Äôs production of a molecule called Irisin that improves memory and protects our brains against degeneration.\n\n#5 Improves Cardiovascular Health\n\nAerobics makes your heart stronger: Aerobics train your heart to beat more efficiently, so your heart doesn‚Äôt have to work as hard. \n\nThat‚Äôs why aerobically fit people have lower heart rates than non-fit people. In fact, elite athletes often have resting heart rates as low as 40 beats per minute (the average man over 40 is 90bpm).\n\n#6 Decreases Chance of Disease\n\nAerobics ward off most major health risks: Studies also show that aerobics helps reduce your risk of diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure.\n\nHow to Get Started With Aerobic Exercise (4:20)\n\nNow, after understanding these top benefits of aerobic exercise, it‚Äôs also important to look at the best practice for aerobic exercise. Because for those of us with busy schedules, it can be pretty difficult to fit in an hour or two each day of light jogging or running on the treadmill to get these benefits. But thankfully, as you‚Äôll discover in this video, there is a much more time-efficient way to get started with aerobic exercise and still see the amazing effects.\n\n#1 Daily Walking\n#2 Regular Cardio\n#3 Strength & Cardio Circuit Training\n\nSo I hope this guide leaves you with some added motivation to incorporate more aerobic exercise into your routine, and some simple ideas on how to get started. Because once you do, I think you‚Äôll find that aerobic exercise is an essential part of creating the healthy lifestyle you‚Äôre working towards, and it doesn‚Äôt have to eat up a ton of time to make it happen.\n\nIf you feel your lifestyle could use an improvement, then check out our FF30X 30-Day Transformation Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-ff30x-program\nIf you want to start putting on muscle TODAY, check out our Fit Father Old School Muscle Building Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-osm-program\n\nYour friends here at the FFP, \n\n-Dr. Balduzzi + The Men's Health Experts @ The Fit Father Project\n\n**Disclaimer: This information is for reference purposes ONLY and cannot replace personal information you can and should discuss with your Doctor.

With her twins in college, this empty-nester is left trying to mend her fractured friendships. \n\nAlways on the move, Heather Dubrow and husband Terry find themselves routinely commuting between Orange County and their new estate in Beverly Hills. After many years of friendship, Heather and Gina find themselves at odds over loyalty and betrayal. \n\nNo longer a Tres Amiga, Tamra Judge is putting her energy into developing stronger friendships and helping her daughter Sophia, who recently turned 18, navigate her gap year. Tamra‚Äôs damaged friendship with Shannon is hotly contested as she wonders if Shannon is truly remorseful for her accident. \n\nGina Kirschenheiter has leveled up as a realtor, but her professional reputation is called into question after one of the ladies puts her in a sticky situation. Her relationship with Travis takes an unconventional turn when deciding she wants to live separately, but stay together. On top of this, as Gina watches bestie Emily get close to Tamra, she wonders if their friendship will remain the same. \n\nEmily Simpson has gone through an incredible transformation after losing 40 pounds and finds herself trying to adjust to her new healthy lifestyle. When she‚Äôs not helping the wrongly convicted as a part of the California Innocence Project, she‚Äôs questioning the ladies on everything from integrity to intentions. \n\nJennifer Pedranti is ready for a fresh start with Tamra while also trying to prove that her boyfriend, Ryan, is worthy of redemption. While some of the ladies in the group wonder if she has truly learned from her past mistakes, Jennifer finds some commonality with new housewife Katie. New to Orange County, Katie Ginella and her husband, professional golf journalist Matt Ginella, recently moved from San Diego. \n\nNow ready to learn more about her Korean heritage and connect to her roots, Katie decides to explore her adoption further and meet her birth mother. A longtime friend of Heather and Emily, Alexis Bellino comes in full force ready to make waves. She finds her footing with most of the ladies and starts fresh with Tamra, but she instantly finds herself on shaky ground with Shannon as they face off in a series of high-stakes disputes. \n\nCast:\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nTamra Judge\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nKatie Ginella\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Most people think that one only needs to get the right color at the right place but there is an almost infinite number of ways to apply the same color at the same spot and this is where the difference between beginners and masters lies.\nTypically, a beginner will use a very limited selection of paint application techniques: the movement of the brush will most likely come from the fingers and the brush is usually held like a pencil, near the ferrule, which limits the amplitude of the stroke. Very often, the angle of the brush related to the canvas is close to 90¬∞and the pressure is usually stronger than needed, similar to writing. \nObviously, we all went through this and it‚Äôs perfectly normal to have a more limited range of techniques at first. For a beginner, you see, painting is so new that it feels reassuring to start with a paint handling technique that feels familiar, that‚Äôs why the most common thing is to to hold the brush like a pencil. Everybody knows how to write and draw with a pencil so, when you take a paintbrush in your hand, it feels natural to hold it like a pencil.\nAnd let‚Äôs say it right away, it‚Äôs fine ! This way of holding the brush is perfectly adapted for details and finitions, the only problem is‚Ä¶ not everything can be about details and precision. Imagine that you visit a museum and can only look at the paintings through a magnifying glass, that would be a very poor experience because you‚Äôd miss the whole context.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 The problem most beginners have\n01:45  78,732 ways to apply the same color\rat the same spot\n06:44 Break\n07:11 Control the amount of paint in your brush\n07:45 Visualize your brush stroke \n08:53 Not happy?

We cannot be of\nany profit to Him, nor love Him with this first love. Yet God demands of us, that as He has loved us without any second thoughts, so He should be loved by us. In what way can we do this, then, since He demands it of us and we cannot give it to Him? I tell you: through a means which He has established by which we can love Him freely, and without the least regard to any profit of ours: we can be useful, not to Him, which is impossible, but to our neighbour...To show the love we have to Him, we ought to serve and love every rational creature...Every virtue receives life from love, and love is gained in love, that is, by raising the eye of our mind to behold how much we are beloved of God. Seeing ourselves loved, we cannot do otherwise than love...So thou seest that we conceive virtues through God and bring them to the birth for our neighbour.\n-- Saint Catherine of Sienna", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 788, "publish_time": "20240619"}

{"cate": ["Howto & Style"], "query": null, "uploader": "Chris Breier", "uploader_id": "@ChrisBreier", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmaYj7TEwB4", "video_id": "wmaYj7TEwB4", "title": "How to Blend Acrylics Like Oils", "description": "Amazon CHAPTERS\nClick on the time stamp to jump to a specific chapter\n0:00 Introduction\n0:15 Using OPEN acrylics or regular acrylics with retarder\n2:00 How to create smooth blends with acrylics\n5:02 Creating soft edges with acrylics\n8:32 How to keep acrylic paint wet on the palette\n9:53 Finishing touches\n10:22 the finished still life painting\n\nIn this video, I demonstrate how to blend acrylics in a manner that's similar to oils. The secret to blending acrylics is to use acrylic retarder to prevent the paint from drying out too soon. I prefer to use Golden OPEN acrylics because the retarder is already mixed into the paint.\n\nI usually blend acrylics after I apply the colors to the canvas. Another tip is to blend the paint with a soft brush. \n\nI also demonstrate how to create soft edges with acrylics. Soft edges have a blurry, out of focus appearance to them. The soft edges make the hard edges stand out more. This is a way to guide the viewers eye to the focal point.\n\nJudging the colors while placing them on a white canvas can be tricky. I find that I have to adjust the values as the painting progresses.\n\nART SUPPLIES & TOOLS USED IN THIS VIDEO\nAll of the links that lead to Blick Art Materials or Amazon are affiliate links. This means that if you click on a link and make a purchase, I earn a commission at no cost to you.\n\nGOLDEN OPEN ACRYLICS\nI used Golden OPEN acrylics for this painting. They're convenient because the retarder is already in the paint, in the proper proportions. The link below contains sets of small tubes of OPEN acrylics so you can try them out, or you can buy the standard sized tubes of individual colors.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5m9\n\nTHE COLORS I USED IN THIS PAINTING\nTitanium White \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcp\nAmazon https://amzn.to/334LyRp\n\nQuinacridone Magenta \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcq\nAmazon https://amzn.to/34rtEt7\n\nUltramarine Blue \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcs\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3f7k9RX\n\nHansa Yellow Opaque \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcu\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3sYSB9w\n\nCarbon Black \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcx\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3qRnNoe\n\nACRYLIC RETARDERS\nYou can add retarder to any brand of acrylics to make them dry slower. This is useful if you already have a brand of acrylics that you prefer. Follow the instructions, you usually don't want to add any more than 25%-30% retarder because it may take too long to dry. The paint may remain tacky even after it dries if you add too much. \n\nGolden Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5mc\nLiquitex Slo-Dri Medium http://shrsl.com/2j5me\nWinsor & Newton Galeria Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5mi\nGrumbacher Artists Acrylic Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5ml\n\nBRUSHES\nI use mostly synthetic brushes that are made for acrylics like these ones from Robert Simmons\nhttp://shrsl.com/3a082\nThe softer brushes are for watercolor.\n\nACRYLIC PALETTES\nThe Masterson Stay Wet Palette is a large plastic box with a tight fitting lid. It comes with a sponge and palette paper. I find that I don't need the sponge to keep the OPEN acrylics wet, but you may need to use it if you live in a very hot and dry climate. It works better than a Tupperware container because the sides of the wall are lower, and it's large. Here is the 12\"x16\" Masterson Palette I use in the video http://shrsl.com/2j5n4\n\nThis is the smaller palette that I store inside of the Masterson Palette.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5nc\n\nSince the OPEN acrylics stay wet for so long, I never really have to peel the paint off. I just clean it with a wet paper towel or rag. I find the microfiber towels work great.\n\nMICROFIBER TOWELS\nI bought a large package of these on Amazon, the link is below. The small fibers create more surface area than paper towels and they do seem to make it easier to clean things. They work great for drying paint brushes and cleaning palettes. Make sure that you handle them properly if you use them with oil paints because they can spontaneously combust.\nhttps://amzn.to/2GdvMsn\n\nTABLE TOP EASEL\nThis is where you can buy the easel I use in the video:\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5ni\n\nI have been using this table top easel for some time now and I like how portable it is. The top folds down and it has a handle which makes it easy to carry. The drawer on the bottom opens to the side and the inside is divided into separate compartments for storing pencils, brushes, and tubes of paint.\n\nPAINT SPATULA\nThis paint spatula from Princeton is handy tool to have in the studio.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5no\n\nCANVAS PANELS\nI've tried out a number or brands of canvas panels, but I'm really fond of the ones made by Raymar. They're acrylic primed and they're backed with a gray melamine that makes them even more resistant to warping. You can buy them on Blick http://shrsl.com/2j5nr\n\nUSING PENCIL TO SKETCH ON CANVAS\nPencils with harder leads are less likely to smear as you paint over them. I discuss this in-depth on my blog.\nhttps://drawandpaintforfun.com/best-pencil-on-canvas/\n\nMUSIC: \"A Night Alone\" by TrackTribe", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 641, "publish_time": "20200930"}

You know the feeling when you‚Äôre half way through a painting and it isn‚Äôt working out? Maybe it‚Äôs not the values, drawing or the colour - very likely it‚Äôs just that the set up was put together too quickly without a lot of thought.\n\nSo it's really worth takng some time to learn how to set up a still life. Good still life paintings (and most paintings, really) rely on the pattern of lights and darks, and you can create that before you even squeeze out any paint by carefully putting together the still life composition on your stand.

It produced reasonable power from 1250rpm and crested at around 4500rpm, providing a near perfect torque band before reaching the speed cutoff at 7000rpm. \n\nBecause BMW intended the engine to function reliably and retain the feel of a much larger v8, throttle lag was practically non-existent (for a turbo engine). \n\nThe N55 prefers higher octane gasoline because it provides more power and better efficiency, with most users saying that the expense per mile is the same as when using low octane fuel. \n\nThe N54 and N55 engines were identical in many ways, but the most notable change was that the later N55 model had a contemporary single twinscroll turbine, as opposed to the N54's twin-turbocharger.\n\nA single turbo is less expensive, lighter, and has a few advantages, but the twin-turbo configuration provides more possible power increases from upgrades. However, the benefits of a bigger single twin scroll turbo are still substantial and sufficient for most tuning tasks. Surprisingly, Alpina chose a twin turbo system in their performance versions. Generally, the N55 improved on the N54 and was in production from 2009 to 2015, when it was superseded by the B57 engine. \n\nWith the introduction of the Alpina tuned models we saw the N55 factory power varies from a respectable 302 bhp to 425 bhp and with mapping adjustments it is possible to add around 80hp on the basic engine.\n\nAir Induction kits and Exhaust will NOT usually ADD TORQUE for most stock N55 configurations on their own, but they will allow you to increase power after other improvements by removing the limitation you hit with other mods as the factory setup runs out of capacity to cope. \n\nFlowing and porting the Head - Flowing and porting the head will get air streaming into the engine while eliminating turbulence or limitations. \n\nTurbo upgrades - forced induction is the most important method to increase the air flow to your intake, enabling you to consume more gasoline and gain power. \n\nN55 remapping offers the most power for the money, but new ECUs and integrated Tuning boxes are also options.\n\nChapters\n0:00 Intro\n2:34 Spark Plug Selection\n3:00 Intercoolers\n4:07 Turbo Upgrades\n6:00 Fuel - Port Injection Fuel Types\n6:17 Engine Tuning (Remapping)\n8:08 Induction Kits & Intakes\n9:05 Head Work Gas Flowing Valves\n10:15 Stronger Engine Parts\n11:11 Injector Upgrades\n12:02 Exhaust Mods \n14:20 Forged Crank Pistons\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IG-bqFLaujU?t=181 Intercoolers\n\nThe following cars came with the N55 engine: 2009‚Äì2017 F10/F11/F07 535i, 2010‚Äì2013 E90/E91/E92/E93 335i, 2010‚Äì2013 E82/E88 135i, 2010‚Äì2017 F25 X3 xDrive35i, 2011‚Äì2013 E70 X5 xDrive35i, 2011‚Äì2015 F30/F31 335i, 2011‚Äì2014 E71 X6 xDrive35i, 2012‚Äì2015 E84 X1 xDrive35i, 2013‚Äì2016 F32/F33/F36 435i, 2014‚Äì2018 F15 X5 xDrive35i, 2014‚Äì2019 F16 X6 xDrive35i, and 2014‚Äì2016 F26 X4 xDrive35i.

It was the custom shop behind the first really mainstream car show, Pimp My Ride, and since Pimp My  Ride ended the shop has gone on to be behind another car show named Inside West Coast Customs. \n\nThe shop has a very interesting history too and is probably the one shop in the world that does not have an exact founding date. According to some, the shop was founded way back in 1994, and others say it was 1997.\n\nIn any case, what we do know for sure is that the shop was incorporated in the year 2000 by Ryan Friedlinghaus, a young mechanic who had a passion for building custom made cars. \n\nHowever, Friedlinghaus had discovered quite early in his life that there were almost no garages that could do all everything needed to make a custom car in-house. \n\nSo he created West Coast Customs as a shop that could make custom cars from top to bottom without outsourcing any part of the vehicle. That was his vision for West Coast Customs, and for a while, that was precisely what the shop was. \n\nAt first, the shop did not get a lot of orders, but soon celebrities like Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal started bringing their expensive cars around for custom effects and that is when West Coast Customs blew up.\n\nBefore long, the shop drew the attention of media giants MTV and they pitched the show Pimp My Ride to Friedlinghaus. But here was the catch, Friedlinghaus was not going to be the host of the show. It would merely be hosted in his shop and he would be the one to coordinate the actual work on the vehicles. The real host of the show would be a rapper named Xzibit. \n\nIn the end, Pimp My Ride was a successful show, but after the first few years, West Coast Customs started seeing the first problems that would eventually run the shop out of reality TV shows forever. \n\n#InsideWestCoastCustoms", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 507, "publish_time": "20220627"}

First off, there's not a single Porsche part on the car.\n\nPorsche Engineering Services helped with reengineering the W124's engine compartment to fit in the 32-valve, 4-cam M119 V-8 ‚Äî for both the 400E and the 500E.\n\nBut the 500E doesn't use the same V-8 as the 500SL. It needed shorter connecting rods so that it fit in the same physical space as the 4.2-liter 400E ‚Äî this way only one structural variant needed to be produced.\n\nThe 400E was a response to the Lexus LS400. Why do you think it wasn't called a 420E?\n\nPorsche also did the engineering to bolt up wheels, tires, brakes, and suspension components from the wider and heavier R129 500SL and W124 500SEL. That necessitated fender flares so wide that the 500E didn't fit down the regular W124 production line in Sindelfingen. \n\nFor both models, Porsche performed the physical modifications to Mercedes-built W124 chassis, and sent them back to Sindelfingen for paint. The 400E remained there, but because of its width, the 500E was sent back to Porsche, which assembled the 500E at a second Zuffenhausen factory.\n\nWith Bruno Sacco's revolutionary looks, aerodynamics, obsession with safety, and Mercedes build quality and engineering might, the W124 was certainly among the best (and most expensive) sedans in the world.\n\nStill is. It's close to perfect. But it's not a Porsche Sports Sedan.\n\n=\n\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

Kitco regrets the error.]\n\nMargins are still a struggle for the miners despite energy costs coming down, said Rick Rule, president and CEO of Rule Investment Media.\n\nRule Spoke to Kitco Mining on Wednesday at the 2024 Precious Metals Summit Beaver Creek in Colorado. Rule is also the former CEO and president of Sprott U.S. Holdings.\n\nRule said it is a good market to invest in. He sees opportunities due to the disparity between rising commodity prices and stagnant equity prices. He focuses on companies with proven management teams and large-scale projects. Rule is open to investing in jurisdictions with perceived political risk.\n\nBut a lot of juniors are too small to make it, said Rule. \n\n‚ÄúMost of the juniors are subscale. They are so small that general administrative expenses consume most of the capital they raise,‚Äù said Rule. \n\n‚ÄúThose companies are doomed to fail. I suspect that three quarters of the juniors that are public worldwide ‚Äî Australia, Canada, the United States, Great Britain ‚Äî are valueless, absolutely valueless.‚Äù \n\nRule said the cost of oil has dropped, which helps, but other costs keep climbing. \n\n‚ÄúEnergy costs have moderated, which is a good thing,‚Äù said Rule. ‚ÄúBut the social take, which is to say taxes, royalties‚Ä¶ things like that are increasing ‚Äî at about 15 percent compounded. Labor costs are going up, spare parts are going up, finished steel is going up. \n\n‚ÄúI think there will be continued disappointment among investors about the fact that the margins, the producing margins, aren't increasing as fast as one would hope, given the increase in gold price.‚Äù\n\nRule said investors have to keep scale in mind. Bigger is better. \n\n‚ÄúEverything that can go wrong with a big mine can go wrong with a small mine,‚Äù said Rule. ‚ÄúBut a small mine can never make you big money.‚Äù\n\nStanding out is key, Rule said.

If you‚Äôre looking for a simple yet very effective way of losing weight and improving your overall health, walking is something just for you. \nPeople who are physically active throughout their life are much less prone to this disease than those who have a more sedentary lifestyle. And that‚Äôs because they have more volume in their hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning.   \nA daily half-hour walk helps avoid serious problems, like coronary heart disease to name one, by lowering high blood pressure and cholesterol levels and improving blood circulation. Because of better-quality and deeper breathing, some symptoms associated with lung disease can show significant improvement thanks to walking. \nMuscle tone and weight loss is also totally achievable through simple walking. Find your optimal pace, but don‚Äôt break out into a jog. This sort of speed walking is low impact and doesn‚Äôt require any recovery time, which means no sore muscles to keep you from getting out and walking the next day.\nThe Arthritis Foundation recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate walking a day to reduce pain, stiffness, and inflammation in the joints. Building strong bones will help you prevent osteoporosis and reduce bone loss. Walking contributes to better blood circulation within the spinal structures, pumping important nutrients into the soft tissues and improving posture and flexibility, both of which are vital for a healthy spine.\nA group of researchers at Iowa State University worked with hundreds of college students. Walking changed their mood for the better, even though no one warned them it could do so.\nIf you still don‚Äôt feel motivated enough to start walking for your health, try joining a class or find a buddy who also wouldn‚Äôt mind getting all the benefits of walking. Another idea could be to hire a personal trainer.\n\nMusic: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music\n\nTIMESTAMPS\nBrain-boosting effect 0:45\nImproved eyesight 1:44\nPrevention of heart disease 2:47\nIncreased lung volume 3:14\nBenefits for the pancreas 3:51\nImproved digestion 4:23\nToned muscles 4:59\nSturdier bones and joints 5:45\nBack pain relief 6:10\nA calmer mind 7:04\nBonus: the FIT formula 8:00\n\nSUMMARY\n-Walking prevents the early onset of dementia, reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and improves your overall mental well-being by reducing stress and releasing endorphins.\n-Get on the road to improve vision and protect your eyes now from potential problems, such as glaucoma, in the future. \n-Walking is no less effective than running when it comes to the prevention of heart disease and stroke.\n-Walking is an aerobic exercise, which means that it increases oxygen flow in the bloodstream and helps eliminate toxins and waste, which is great for your lungs. \n-Walking for exercise is a surprisingly more effective way to prevent diabetes than running is.\n-Just half an hour of walking every day not only lowers the risk of developing colon cancer but also improves digestion and regulates bowel movements.\n-Just 10,000 steps a day can be just as effective as a full-blown workout at the gym, especially if you add some intervals or uphill walking.\n-Walking can provide more joint mobility, prevent the loss of bone density, and even reduce the risk of fractures.\n-Walking is a real life-saver for those who experience back pain during more challenging high-impact exercises.\n-Walking improves depression symptoms in patients with MDD, just imagine how easily it could help us cope with just feeling down or exhausted.\n-Keep in mind the FIT formula. It stands for Frequency (how often), Intensity (how fast), and Time (for how long).\n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\n\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.brightside.me/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 608, "publish_time": "20180416"}

Furthermore, nearly 80% of those individuals who suffer a sprain are likely to experience re-injury.\n\nA number of studies have demonstrated the positive effects of exercise for treating ankle sprains, but researchers have questioned how the addition of manual therapy might influence outcomes.\n\nIn 2013, Cleland and colleagues demonstrated that those put in a manual therapy (joint mobilizations) plus exercise group did better in terms of pain and function than those in an exercise-only group at 4 weeks and 6 months.\n\nThere is a lot of hate out there right now for manual therapy, and while I realize exercise has the best evidence, ankle sprains may be one issue where seeing a physio for a combination of skilled manual care and exercise guidance would be wise.\n\nReferences: \n\n1.

After reviewing the research out there, it seems that using heavy or light weights actually doesn‚Äôt matter much in terms of hypertrophy. Studies show that muscle growth tends to be equal despite using light weights or heavy weights (high rep vs low rep). But this is only true when going to near failure, and one benefit of lifting heavy weights is the better strength gains you see when compared to light weights. Based on this, as you‚Äôll see in my video, your best bet is to incorporate high reps with light weights AND low reps with heavy weights into your workout. This will enable you to target both metabolic stress and mechanical tension; both are important mechanisms of muscle growth. \n\nLIGHT WEIGHTS VS HEAVY WEIGHTS ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/light-weights-heavy-weights/ \n\n You can browse around my website and read the articles I do have up (I‚Äôll be adding more articles on a regular basis).

Dr. Mandell", "description": "Engaging in calf pumps while seated offers an array of health benefits that extend far beyond simple leg exercise. Firstly, this activity significantly enhances circulation by utilizing the \"muscle pump\" mechanism. When the calf muscles contract, they compress the veins running through them, effectively pushing blood upward towards the heart. The one-way valves in these veins prevent the blood from flowing back down, ensuring efficient venous return and reducing the risk of blood pooling, swelling, and conditions like varicose veins. Improved circulation means that oxygen and nutrients are more effectively delivered throughout the body, supporting overall cellular function and health.\n\nAdditionally, calf pumps play a crucial role in blood sugar regulation. The muscle contractions increase glucose uptake from the bloodstream into the muscle cells, where it is used for energy, thereby helping to lower blood sugar levels. This process also improves insulin sensitivity, meaning the body requires less insulin to manage blood glucose levels effectively. Enhanced insulin sensitivity is particularly beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, as it helps to maintain more stable blood sugar levels and reduces the risk of postprandial glucose spikes.\n\nMoreover, calf pumps can significantly aid in digestion. The improved circulation ensures that digestive organs receive a better supply of oxygen and nutrients, which enhances their functionality. The physical activity also stimulates the autonomic nervous system, promoting peristalsis‚Äîthe wave-like contractions that move food through the digestive tract. This helps to prevent common digestive issues such as bloating and constipation, leading to more efficient digestion and nutrient absorption.\n\nIncorporating regular calf pumps while seated can also help reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition that can occur during prolonged periods of inactivity, such as long flights or desk jobs. By promoting blood flow and reducing stasis in the veins, calf pumps serve as a preventative measure against this potentially serious condition. Additionally, improved lymphatic circulation facilitated by these exercises aids in the removal of metabolic waste products, contributing to overall better health and reduced inflammation.\n\nIn summary, the simple act of performing calf pumps while seated offers numerous health benefits, including enhanced circulation, improved blood sugar regulation and insulin sensitivity, better digestion, and protection against conditions like DVT. This easy-to-implement activity is a powerful tool for maintaining and improving overall health, especially for individuals who spend extended periods sitting.\n\n****************************************************\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

This video provides information about the cerebellum connection.  All balancing exercises in this video are inspired by the book ADHD 2.0 by Edward Hallowell and John Ratey.  The balancing exercises in this video target the cerebellum and the vestibular system of the inner ear. These two areas combined are referred to as the vestibulo cerebellar system.  Compelling evidence from research citings in this book suggest that strengthening this system not only improves physical skill but also attention and focus and emotional regulation. Chapter three of this book goes into detail regarding the cerebellum connection. What interested me the most about this connection is the affect of calming emotions.  I've personally tried balancing exercises with children who struggle with emotional dysregulation and I've seen first had how the balancing is used as a \"bottom up\" regulation tool that younger children can access to help bring balance to an emotionally hijacked brain. Since their frontal lobes are so underdeveloped (the frontal lobes are used for \"top down\" regulation techniques), this is an exciting intervention for them to experience.  The book introduces the concept of stimulating the cerebellum through balance to regulate emotions and increase focus and attention. Since reading ADHD 2.0 I have introduced all the children and teens I work with to balancing exercises and I made this video for them to practice over the summer and outside of school hours.  This is just an introduction to some of the most popular balancing activities.  I've also incorporated some Bal-a-Vis-X with the two small rubber balls and the cross body movements.  \n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nThe balance board can be found on Amazon.\n\nBook: ADHD 2.0  (found on Amazon and other book sellers).\n\nThe book mentions a program called Zing Performance.

This all happens in the blink of an eye. Even at a younger age you will see people who play sports can do this much faster and land much more safely than people who do not play sport. This is a skill that can be trained and needs constant exposure to maintain it's fast response. A very slow response is what you see with an older person who has not spent time developing skills of balance, agility and power. The chance of a injury from a fall is very likely. \n\n\nMost of the current core workouts is all about training abdominal muscles in isolation using crunches, planks, and various other floor based exercises. The belief here is that if you train your core like you would with a bicep curl to make a bicep stronger, you will have improved balance and function. Unfortunately it does not work this way at all. For starters there is no need for fast reflex reactions as you are already on the floor. Secondly, planks and other traditional abdominal exercises are of little use to the older adult and more likely to cause more harm than good for these exercises are all about stiffness and rigidity. The older adult already has too much stiffness and rigidity, they do not need more.\n\nThe key is in using exercises that demand a reflex response that can teach them more effective ways to restore balance and stability.\n\nWe know the amazing benefits of agility training with sports for improving reaction times and reflex skills. The same is true for older adults but instead of improved sporting performance we may be able to save their life!\n\nStatistics in the US show that one adult over the age of 65 is treated in the emergency room for a fall every 18 seconds (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Quite an alarming statistic and even more scary when you consider that hip fractures are the most common injury from a fall and the number one cause of nursing home admission. Approximately 50% of those who suffer a hip fracture never fully regain their mobility and independence, and 50% of those die within the first year! Falling for an older adult is a very serious matter, and a life threatening situation. \n\nOther great articles to read about this subject are below\n\nStability Training What Is It Really & How To Do It\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/246-stability-training-what-is-it-really-why-is-it-so-important\n\nStrength Training For Older Adults\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/179-can-you-slow-the-ageing-process-with-exercise\n\nReduce Arthritis & Improve Bone Density\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/214-how-to-reduce-arthritis-symptoms-improve-overall-bone-density\n\nAnd if you live in Melbourne and would like to know more about our specific Older Adults Strength Training program go to our website in the link below\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/187-stronger-for-longer-older-adults-training", "quality": "1440x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20190221"}

You see, the core is generally made up of four key components. Namely - the rectus abdominus (6pack / lower abs), obliques, the serratus anterior, and the transverse abdominus (inner abs).\n\nüëâCoaching Programs: https://www.fraserwilsonfitness.com\n\nThe obliques are an absolute must when it comes to developing an aesthetic physique. If your goal is to attain the V tapered look, there‚Äôs no way around training them.

Overall, you can‚Äôt skimp on your obliques for aesthetic and performance, and the best way to ensure that you stay on track is to keep your workouts fresh & challenging\n\nThe serratus is a muscle that originates on your upper rib cage and attaches to the media border of the shoulder blade (basically the shark gill looking things). The serratus muscles play a pivotal role in framing out your abs, obliques and lower pec.

You've come to the right place!\n\n\n---\n\n\nWhy do you get so sore after leg day?\n\n\nWe know that our muscles get sore when we work them hard, whether that‚Äôs through lifting heavy weights, doing tons of reps, or burning them out through long or intense cardio.\n\n\nBut why do legs get more sore than your other muscles? \n\n\nThe simple answer is that there are many muscles in your legs, and they‚Äôre quite large‚Ä¶ which means it‚Äôs a lot harder for them to recover.\n\n\nThere are two different kinds of muscle soreness you should be aware of.\n\n\nThe first kind of muscle soreness is acute, or immediate soreness. As you challenge your muscles, they build up lactic acid, which is what causes the familiar ‚Äúburning sensation‚Äù you get right before your muscles fail.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs this quick onset soreness that you feel in the gym, between sets, or right after you finish your workout.\n\n\nIt typically won‚Äôt last more than a few minutes, or at worst, a few hours after you finish working out.\n\n\nThe second kind of muscle soreness, and the kind that can make leg day miserable, is delayed soreness, often called DOMS or Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.\n\n\nDOMS is exactly what it sounds like, and it explains why your legs are so sore the next day or two after a tough leg workout.\n\n\nOn a physiological level, the process of lifting weights and building muscle involves causing lots of microscopic tears in your muscle fibers. When these tears are repaired through rest, nutrition, and recovery, you build new muscle and gain strength.\n\n\nBut in the meantime, it can hurt‚Ä¶ a lot! The micro-tears in your muscles will swell, become inflamed, and cause you some pain while they‚Äôre recovering.\n\n\nMost experts believe DOMS are worse in your legs because of the large size of the muscle groups, and the fact that you‚Äôll lift heavier loads than you would during, say, a bicep curl.\n\n\nSo now that you understand a little bit of the science behind leg soreness, you know that it‚Äôs totally normal, and is often a sign of a great workout!\n\n\nBut what can you do to ease that soreness? Here are 5 tips that might help.\n----\n1. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate\n\n\nThis is a good idea on almost any day, but it counts double for recovering from leg day.\n\n\nMake sure you hydrate plenty before, during, and after your workout, as well as in the days following it while you recover.\n\n\nProper hydration helps your muscles heal and delivers nutrients to the parts of your body that need it the most.\n\n\nThere‚Äôs no hard and fast rule for this, but you‚Äôll sometimes see health experts recommend the 8 by 8 approach ‚Äî that‚Äôs eight 8 ounce glasses of water every day.\n---\n\n\n2. Stretch out those quads and hammies!\n\n\nMost people know the importance of properly warming up, but just as important (and probably even more likely to be skipped) is a good cool-down session.\n\n\nAfter squats or deadlifts, you‚Äôll probably be exhausted and ready to go home. But if you‚Äôre having major leg soreness or trouble walking, it‚Äôs probably worth taking a few minutes to stretch after your leg day workout.\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to go overboard, just get a nice deep stretch on your major leg muscles before you call it a day. If it‚Äôs too late and you‚Äôre already home and feeling sore, a good stretch will still help blood flow and recovery in those muscle groups.\n---\n\n\n3. Walk, do yoga, or hit the stationary bike \n\n\nEven though you might be in pain, sitting on the couch doing nothing is probably not the right way to go.\n\n\nGetting back to the gym, if possible, and doing some light work on the stationary bike is PERFECT for leg recovery. It‚Äôs low impact, easy, and will promote great circulation.\n\n\nA gentle yoga class or a long walk are also great options.\n\n\nIt might hurt at first if your legs are really sore, but it should help alleviate the pain sooner than remaining sedentary would.\n---\n\n\n4. Ice those legs down\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre having a brutal leg day hangover, it‚Äôs because you did some serious damage to your muscles on a microscopic level. (Congrats on a great workout, by the way!)\n\n\nAs we talked about above, those little tears and abrasions are going to swell up and feel awful in the process of healing.\n\n\nSo what do you do when something swells up? You ice it down!\n\n\nAn ice pack on your legs will actually narrow the blood vessels and reduce the blood flow to the area, which will help the swelling go down and get you back on your feet.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not ideal for nutrient delivery and recovery, but it will help ease the pain.\n---\n\n\n5. Use a foam roller\n\n\nFoam rollers are a FANTASTIC accessory that can help you work out knots in your muscles, improve mobility, avoid injuries, and promote better recovery after workouts.\n\n\nWhen all else fails and the soreness is just too deep in your muscles, and especially if you‚Äôre having trouble walking, using one of these can really help loosen you back up.\n\n\nLook up a few foam rolling exercises that target your legs and pay careful attention to the technique to get the best results.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20221115"}

Dr. Mandell", "description": "Utilizing a towel as a simple yet effective tool can significantly enhance foot and leg circulation, particularly after a rigorous workout session. Following a day filled with exercises that engage the lower body, a towel can be employed for gentle stretching and massaging, which can help alleviate discomfort and promote better blood flow. To begin, you might sit comfortably on the floor or on a chair or sofa, draping the towel around the arch of your foot while holding the ends. Gently pulling the towel towards you will provide a safe stretch for the calf muscles and Achilles tendon, aiding flexibility and circulation. This stretch not only helps in loosening tight muscles but also encourages venous return, reducing the risk of developing varicose veins and minimizing swelling in the ankles and feet.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating rhythmic movements with the towel can further enhance circulation. For instance, you can perform a \"towel scrunch,\" where you place a towel on the floor and use your toes to scrunch it up towards you. This exercise engages the small muscles in the feet, stimulating blood flow and strengthening foot muscles, thus promoting overall leg health. Using the towel as a prop in various exercises, such as leg extensions or lateral leg raises, can facilitate a greater range of motion and improve circulation in the legs. By engaging in these practices regularly, you not only support your muscle recovery post-workout but also cultivate a habit that promotes long-term circulation health, helping to keep your legs feeling light and energized! Remember, integrating such mindful practices into your routine can significantly impact your overall well-being, helping to prevent discomfort and enhance the vitality of your lower extremities.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

She's answering common facial-filler questions and performing full-face rejuvenations on two of her clients. Filler is a volume inducer, mostly made out of hyaluronic acid, that helps add volume to areas that are shifting downwards because of aging. Common areas patients request are the eyes, cheeks, and lips. However, fillers can also be placed on the chin, jawline, and around the nose. \n\nClients can see a difference immediately after receiving filler, but fully healed results show in about two weeks. One syringe of filler typically costs about $500 to $1,000, and results can last a year to two years. If someone is doing a full facial lift with fillers, such as a combination of the under eyes, cheeks, lips, nasolabial folds, and jawline, that can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $10,000, and those results can last three to four years. If a client isn't happy with their results, hyaluronic acid fillers can be completely dissolved. It's important to visit a professional who will understand your face shape, ethnicity, mental and physical health concerns, and what to do if a treatment has complications.\n\nFor more, please visit Vanessa Lee:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/vanessalee_rn/\nThe Things We Do:\nhttps://thethingswedo.co/. \n\nMORE BEAUTY INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Medical Pedicures Transform Feet\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHuvDvCkbC0&t=13s\n11 Grossly Satisfying Beauty Treatments For Better Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pdzwgKFHI\nHow A Nonsurgical Face-Lift Works | Beauty Explorers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot_2tuwRR2U\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Fillers #BeautyTransformations #BeautyInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

It is even more powerful when paired with the poetry of passionate teens.  \n\nDenise Fellows, prior to SummerWorks, referred to herself as a ‚Äúsilent poet.‚Äù She said that her poetry used to ‚Äòscream so loud to be heard by someone other than her own ears.‚Äô Denise worked with SummerWorks in the summer of 2014, and it was there she began sharing her work.\n\nKira Cobbs was born in 1998 in Denver, CO. She plays the piano and practices Chinese and sign language; she also participates in her school‚Äôs poetry organization, Louder Than a Bomb. She has been writing poetry since she was inspired to do so by her fourth grade teacher. Kira participated in SummerWorks in 2014.\n\n\r\nJasmine Johnson is a sophomore at Benson High School and she participated in SummerWorks 2014.‚ÄúWe all became somewhat of a big family,‚Äù Johnson says of her experienced ‚ÄúI never for a second thought I would enjoy cleaning city parks, but if I could work at SummerWorks again I would. It was an amazing experience and opportunity.‚Äù \r\n\r\nJasmine would like to thank her 7th grade teacher, Ms. Carlson of Monroe Middle School, for introducing her to poetry. Jasmine says poetry is the reasons she is the person she is today; it has helped her through anger, depression, and other life struggles.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The results were compared with those obtained in men during continuous sleep. Although mean levels and area under the curve of testosterone were similar in both groups, fragmented sleep resulted in a significant delay in testosterone rise (03:24 h ¬± 1:13 vs. 22:35 h ¬± 0:22)\nDuring fragmented sleep, nocturnal testosterone rise was observed only in subjects who showed REM episodes (4/10) - findings indicate that the sleep-related rise in serum testosterone levels is linked with the appearance of first REM sleep. The rise in testosterone levels was slower when REM latency was longer in young adult men, testosterone levels begin to rise on falling asleep, peak at about the time of first REM, and remain at the same levels until awakening.\n\nMorning vs Evening Workouts Study - Study - journal PLoS One:\nLooked at the effect of time of day on performance, hormonal and metabolic response during a 1000-M cycling time trial in 9 recreational cyclists, average age 31. The participants performed a 1000-m TT at either 8 am or 6 pm, in randomized, repeated-measures, crossover design a 1000-m cycling time-trial. The time to complete the time trial was lower in the evening than in the morning (88.2 vs 94.7, respectively), but there was no significant different in pacing. However, oxygen uptake and aerobic mechanical power output at 600 and 1000 m tended to be higher in the evening. There was also a main effect of time of day for insulin, cortisol, and total and free testosterone concentration, which were all higher in the morning (+60%, +26%, +31% and +22%, respectively) The norepinephrine response to the exercise was increased in the morning (+46%), and it was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in the response of glucose.\n\nReferences:\n\n1) The Effect of Diurnal Variation on Clinical Measurement of Serum Testosterone and Other Sex Hormone Levels in Men.

That one is no longer available.\n\nThese types of breathing exercises can give improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance and exercise performance. \n\nInspiratory muscle training is basically a series of breathing exercises that aim to strengthen the bodies‚Äô respiratory muscles making it easier for people to breathe. When a person is breathing normally, they typically use between 10 to 15 per cent of his or her total lung capacity. However, with Inspiratory muscle training, a person can typically increase the amount of lung capacity used. \n\nA tool that can help with inspiratory muscle training is a high altitude training mask like the one from Perpetual Air featured in the video. These masks restrict air flow and can help with inspiratory muscle training. The Perpetual Air mask has various levels of air restriction that are easily adjusted.\n\nThe following exercises can be done either with our without a high altitude training mask.\n\nThe first breathing exercise is very simple. Breath in through your nose for 2 seconds and breath out through your mouth with pursed lips for 4 seconds. \n\nNow you are going to move your arms with the breathing to loosen up the muscles around your chest area. \n\nFinally, breathing with your diaphragm, or belly breathing, is a great way to relax and improve your breathing.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nBreathing Exercises for Relaxation or COPD:\nhttps://youtu.be/-7-CAFhJn78\n\n===========================================\n\nSUPPORT me on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo\n\n===========================================\n\nBreathing Exercises for COPD, Asthma, Bronchitis & Emphysema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpTNUGwXbTU\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.

Some MCU actors like Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd were far from ripped and muscular when they were cast in their respective roles. However, they put in the work to attain the fit and athletic bodies they sport on screen. This is no easy feat, as getting your body into peak shape is an incredibly difficult task. Sometimes it take‚Äôs over a year of strict dieting and workout plans to achieve their goals. And then years more maintaining this shape for future movies in the MCU.

As we get older, our testosterone tends to naturally decline. We can‚Äôt stop it completely, but we can fight back against the loss of our needed male hormones. Having less fat and more muscle is crucial for our testosterone production. When you think of building muscle, you think of resistance training and lifting weights at the gym or at home. While that is the major key for building muscle, there are some needs you need to fo to help optimize muscle growth.\n\nAside from resistance training, there are 2 more major keys for building muscle faster after 50. Recovery and getting good quality sleep is another crucial part for building muscle. That is the time when your body works on repairing the muscle fibers you damage from your workouts, helping them grow bigger during the recovery. \n\nThe last major component is nutrition. In order to build more muscle, you need to make sure that you are consuming enough protein. Protein is the most needed food group in order to build more muscle during your recovery from your workouts. There are a lot of foods you can eat, supplements you can, protein powder you can drink to get protein in your body. That is why I am going to give you 5 great foods that you can eat to help you build more muscle faster after 50.\n\nHere are the 5 foods to help you build muscle faster after 50.

Or in other words, simply figuring out how you‚Äôre going to group your exercises throughout the week. And although there isn‚Äôt one ‚Äúbest workout split‚Äù for everyone, certain muscle building splits have their advantages. For example, we know that training a muscle at least 2x/week is superior to 1x/week. This automatically makes the common bro split inferior to other higher muscle training frequency workout splits. Training splits like the upper lower split, full body workout splits (‚Äútotal body workouts‚Äù), and the push pull legs workout split train each muscle 2x/week whereas the bro split does not. This not only helps better optimize protein synthesis but also enables you to get more quality sets done since your workout volume is spread out over multiple workouts.\n\nBut which of these splits should you choose for mass? Well, it depends on your training experience. The best workout split for beginners looking to put on mass is likely a 3 day workout split with full body workouts. This is because you can train the compound lifts frequently and master them very quickly without causing too much muscle damage. Then, as you gain experience and need more volume to progress, you can switch to a 4 day workout split (such as the upper/lower split) to help spread out your volume better throughout the week. And then, as you progress even more, switching to a 5 day workout split or a 6 day workout split (push pull legs for example) would be wise to keep your workouts from being excessively long and fatiguing. However, despite what research says, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that workout volume and consistency are the more important factors. So choose the workout split that you enjoy the most and best fits your schedule ‚Äì as that‚Äôs going to be the best option for you! \n\nAnd if you‚Äôre looking for a step-by-step program that shows you how to optimize your training and nutrition in order to progress as efficiently as possible, then simply take my starting-point analysis tool below to find which program is best for you: \nhttps://builtwithscience.com/bws-free-fitness-quiz/gender?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=Video&utm_content=Description%20box&utm_campaign=Science%20based%20back%20split%20to%20maximize%20growth%20Jan%206%2F2019\n\nLINK TO WRITTEN ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/best-workout-split/ \n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM & FACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeremyethier/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Jeremyethierfit/\n\nMUSIC:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\nSTUDIES:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729395\n\nOTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES:\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/frequency-muscle/\nhttps://mennohenselmans.com/optimal-program-design/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 427, "publish_time": "20190106"}

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nThe success of Joker and Venom has completely changed the way movie studios are looking at superhero movies. No longer are our caped heroes standing front and center. With Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad coming soon, we could see a whole slate of super-villain movies hitting the big screen. Why bother trying another stab at remaking the Fantastic Four when there‚Äôs such a better character to focus on instead? Doctor Doom stood in the shadows of both Fantastic Four franchises, serving as the main villain, but not getting fleshed out enough to truly becoming a compelling part of the films. Catwoman had her shot at a solo movie with Halle Berry‚Äôs disappointing cheesefest back in 2004, but there‚Äôs another DC vixen who could really shine with a solo story -- and her name is Poison Ivy. Just the thought of Poison Ivy on the big screen has probably conjured some pretty bad memories of Batman and Robin, but let‚Äôs just pull that withered weed from the garden and start over. Despite the cheesy puns about ice, snow, and everything frozen, you cannot deny the dramatic possibilities of the Mr. Freeze origin story we saw glimpses of in the 1997 disaster Batman & Robin. Arnold Schawnegger‚Äôs portrayal of Mr. Freeze is pretty much a big joke now and has resulted in no other portrayals of the character on the big-screen, but he definitely has a great story to tell. \n\nThe Joker did a deep dive into the character‚Äôs psyche, backstory, and provided a whole new perspective on the madness behind him. But what other villains deserve a similar movie treatment? Between some Marvel juggernauts and DC villains who deserve proper big-screen treatment, let‚Äôs see who should go solo in the future!\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 635, "publish_time": "20191024"}

Initially I was a little apprehensive, worried that my drawing skills might have deteriorated during my time away.\n\nBut as I mention in the video, to my surprise they‚Äôd actually improved! I‚Äôm not sure what the exact reason behind this is, but I suspect that after getting some distance my brain had time to process everything I‚Äôd learned. So when I eventually started drawing again, it was all still there!\n\nI do feel like my work has a bit more rhythm to it now, which feels great. I‚Äôm not thinking about it, or judging it as much anymore. I‚Äôm not too concerned about the small things. The creation process seems to have become quite fluid for me as of recently and I‚Äôm thankful for that.\n\nThe idea for this character design sketch came about after I‚Äôd spent long enough thinking about an idea that had been fermenting inside my mind for the last few months. It was an idea for a comic book, and the more I thought about it, the more complete it became.\n\nEventually I‚Äôd somehow worked out an entire plot in my head without writing anything down at all, and at that point I figured hey, why not put pencil to paper and see if I can‚Äôt come up with a few cool character concepts for this story?\n\nThe character in this video is one of the key players in the plot. He works at a robotics plant where he manufactures bio mechanical replacement bodies for people to transfer their consciousness to when their organic bodies become obsolete. \n\nThe catch is that these body replacements, otherwise known as capsules, are reserved only for the wealthy and the powerful. \nSo of course this character, being a mere engineer at a manufacturing plant would never be able get his hands on one of these bio mechanical bodies, which is unfortunate for him because it just so happens that his younger brother is terminally ill with a rare disease that can‚Äôt be cured. \n\nHowever, he loves his brother and would do anything to save him ‚Äì so he does the unthinkable, illegally uploading his brothers consciousness into a capsule which does not belong to him.\n\nIn fact, this capsule has been set aside and belongs to one of the most powerful and feared gangsters in the entire city. And that‚Äôs just the beginning of the story! But I‚Äôll leave it there for now. I don‚Äôt want to give away too much just yet ‚Äì especially because I have no idea when I‚Äôll get round to actually putting this comic together!\n\nI hope you enjoy the video! \n\nThanks for watching! \n-Clayton\n\nSoftware Used: Manga Studio\n\nIf you like the video, show your support by commenting, sharing or subscribing. \n\nComic Art Community - https://www.howtodrawcomics.net/comic-art-community/\nHow to Draw Comics .NET - http://www.howtodrawcomics.net/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/howtodrawcomics/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/howtodrawcomics\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/howtodrawcomics\nTumblr - http://howtodrawcomics.tumblr.com/\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/howtodrawcomics/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1271, "publish_time": "20190409"}

Strangely satisfying", "description": "Chill out for 10 mins and let us do the work.\n\nI use timelapse filming mainly to prove to myself that at the end of the day I have actually done some work! Most of these shots cover several hours of digging condensed into just a matter of seconds- but when you're in the woods digging, especially if you're alone, progress can seem painfully slow sometimes! Making a big landing takes so much effort, the volume of dirt alone can mean hundreds, maybe thousands of wheelbarrows to fill, move and empty. \n\nI find that filming a timelapse stops me from getting lazy - if I stop digging to call or message someone it looks very obvious in the shot. You have to keep busy and keep moving. It's a good way of making sure you don't stop until the job is done. I generally set myself a target of something to achieve and then don't go home until it's done- even if it means getting lights out of my car and digging into the night. \n\nThis video is a mash-up of some of the timelapses I have shot over the last few years either of me alone (cheeky week day visits) or with the crew all digging together on Sunday. Even tho we're hopefully nearing the point when we can all return to our local trail spots- it's been weeks since I have ridden or done any digging. I plan to ease myself back into things and spend more time on a shovel than a bike for a while. \n\nReally hope you enjoy the video... Next week's video is a little different from the norm so look out for that one!\n\nTake it easy - oh yeah and subscribe ;-)", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 545, "publish_time": "20200515"}

After completing a two-year journey in our Airstream to see all 50 states and 51 National Parks, we left to travel abroad. We have downsized our possessions and sold our home so that we can wander about with only the things in our backpacks. \n\nWe love living on the road, traveling each week to a new location. We plan to travel extensively to every part of the world. Ours is not a slow travel lifestyle but rather a vagabondish one. The goal is not to check a country off a list, but to experience it by meeting new people, seeing how others live, and making new friends. We believe in laughing, loving, and living our lives to the fullest. \n\nWe are working hard to build a beautiful website where you can get travel information about the places we have been. In addition, we post blog articles to help you travel better. Our channel is a way of augmenting that effort, so sometimes we post videos about how to travel or a vlog showing our lives on the road as we do an activity or an adventure. We also post Shorts, so check those out, too. We hope to entertain you, but most importantly, we want to inspire you and give you the confidence to plan your own adventure around the world. \n\nVideo # 128\n\nWe invite you to subscribe and comment.

This is just the spot to cool off after a day on the beach. Laze around the pool, or move to the shaded deck upstairs and enjoy burgers fresh off the grill seated at the covered dining area. You can even watch your favorite sports channel on the outdoor TV.\n\nBe sure to turn the lights on around the pool at night and see how beautiful it is .\n\nThere are child protective gates on both levels of the house, so young children will not be able to access the pool area without an adult opening the gate.\n\nJumping and diving are not permitted and there should always be adult supervision when there are children in the pool.\n\nWhen the kids get tired of swimming in the pool they can move to the garage and play ping pong and fuss ball. You can open the garage door and then lower a screened door to allow for ventilation. And just in case the kids work up a thirst there is a small refrigerator there also. This is handy for the pool area too, so you don't have to go back to the house for cold drinks.\n\nThe outdoor shower with hot and cold water is just outside the garage - perfect for getting all the sand off before hitting the pool!\n\nThe kitchen is super well stocked and has everything you will need to prepare meals for your group. It has a breakfast bar with additional seating just in case there is not enough room for everyone round the dining table.\n\nThe 3 bedrooms consist of a king in the master bedroom with TV, large walk in closet and en suite bathroom.\n\nThe second bedroom has a queen bed and TV and the third bedroom is ideal for kids with a bunk bed with a single on top and a double below - and then there is even another bed that pulls out. The kids will love it! And they also have their own TV!\n\nThe den downstairs is comfy and cozy with an electric fireplace, 65 inch TV, games for the kids and there is also a queen sleeper sofa for those extra guests.\n\nThe third bathroom and laundry is also on this level and is convenient to the pool - no need to go all the way upstairs.\n\nOf course the house has ceiling fans in all rooms, wifi, pool toys and chairs for the beach with a buggy to transport them over. It literally takes about 3 minutes to walk from the house to the closest beach access - it is really no distance at all.\n\nThe house is dog friendly for most breeds with a 40 pound limit on size. You will have to show proof of vet prescribed flea medication and provide covers to protect furniture and bedding from pet hair.\n\nThree grocery stores are near by and the historic downtown is about 10 minutes by car, so the situation is ideal and this house really offers everything possible to make this your best vacation ever!", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 303, "publish_time": "20190627"}

Particularly ones that are very time efficient and effective.\n\nThe Top Health Benefits of Aerobic Exercise (0:44)\n\n#1 Helps Build a Stronger Immune System\n\nMost guys don‚Äôt know that consistent aerobic exercise is research-proven to keep your immune system strong and help your body ward off common illnesses like the flu or a cold.\n\n#2 Great Way to Burn Fat\n\nAerobics also increase your fat-burning capacity ‚Äì long after you‚Äôre done exercising: By regularly doing aerobic exercise, your muscles develop a higher number of mitochondria, which help you burn more fat at rest ‚Äì even when you‚Äôre not exercising.\n\n#3 Correlated with a Longer Lifespan\n\nAerobics help you live longer: According to the newest scientific research, those who engage in aerobic exercise live longer than those who do not.\n\n#4 Helps Improve Your Brain Function\n\nAerobics makes you smarter: New research also shows that aerobics increases your brain‚Äôs production of a molecule called Irisin that improves memory and protects our brains against degeneration.\n\n#5 Improves Cardiovascular Health\n\nAerobics makes your heart stronger: Aerobics train your heart to beat more efficiently, so your heart doesn‚Äôt have to work as hard. \n\nThat‚Äôs why aerobically fit people have lower heart rates than non-fit people. In fact, elite athletes often have resting heart rates as low as 40 beats per minute (the average man over 40 is 90bpm).\n\n#6 Decreases Chance of Disease\n\nAerobics ward off most major health risks: Studies also show that aerobics helps reduce your risk of diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure.\n\nHow to Get Started With Aerobic Exercise (4:20)\n\nNow, after understanding these top benefits of aerobic exercise, it‚Äôs also important to look at the best practice for aerobic exercise. Because for those of us with busy schedules, it can be pretty difficult to fit in an hour or two each day of light jogging or running on the treadmill to get these benefits. But thankfully, as you‚Äôll discover in this video, there is a much more time-efficient way to get started with aerobic exercise and still see the amazing effects.\n\n#1 Daily Walking\n#2 Regular Cardio\n#3 Strength & Cardio Circuit Training\n\nSo I hope this guide leaves you with some added motivation to incorporate more aerobic exercise into your routine, and some simple ideas on how to get started. Because once you do, I think you‚Äôll find that aerobic exercise is an essential part of creating the healthy lifestyle you‚Äôre working towards, and it doesn‚Äôt have to eat up a ton of time to make it happen.\n\nIf you feel your lifestyle could use an improvement, then check out our FF30X 30-Day Transformation Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-ff30x-program\nIf you want to start putting on muscle TODAY, check out our Fit Father Old School Muscle Building Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-osm-program\n\nYour friends here at the FFP, \n\n-Dr. Balduzzi + The Men's Health Experts @ The Fit Father Project\n\n**Disclaimer: This information is for reference purposes ONLY and cannot replace personal information you can and should discuss with your Doctor.

Most people think that one only needs to get the right color at the right place but there is an almost infinite number of ways to apply the same color at the same spot and this is where the difference between beginners and masters lies.\nTypically, a beginner will use a very limited selection of paint application techniques: the movement of the brush will most likely come from the fingers and the brush is usually held like a pencil, near the ferrule, which limits the amplitude of the stroke. Very often, the angle of the brush related to the canvas is close to 90¬∞and the pressure is usually stronger than needed, similar to writing. \nObviously, we all went through this and it‚Äôs perfectly normal to have a more limited range of techniques at first. For a beginner, you see, painting is so new that it feels reassuring to start with a paint handling technique that feels familiar, that‚Äôs why the most common thing is to to hold the brush like a pencil. Everybody knows how to write and draw with a pencil so, when you take a paintbrush in your hand, it feels natural to hold it like a pencil.\nAnd let‚Äôs say it right away, it‚Äôs fine ! This way of holding the brush is perfectly adapted for details and finitions, the only problem is‚Ä¶ not everything can be about details and precision. Imagine that you visit a museum and can only look at the paintings through a magnifying glass, that would be a very poor experience because you‚Äôd miss the whole context.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 The problem most beginners have\n01:45  78,732 ways to apply the same color\rat the same spot\n06:44 Break\n07:11 Control the amount of paint in your brush\n07:45 Visualize your brush stroke \n08:53 Not happy?

I cant wait to use that technique again. I was inspired by Chris Dunn for that particular technique, he has a few instagram videos showing how he does it. \n\nIf you have any questions please ask in the comments. \n\n‚ú• The Quote I reference/butcher: \nGod has loved us without being loved, but we love Him because we are loved. We cannot be of\nany profit to Him, nor love Him with this first love. Yet God demands of us, that as He has loved us without any second thoughts, so He should be loved by us. In what way can we do this, then, since He demands it of us and we cannot give it to Him? I tell you: through a means which He has established by which we can love Him freely, and without the least regard to any profit of ours: we can be useful, not to Him, which is impossible, but to our neighbour...To show the love we have to Him, we ought to serve and love every rational creature...Every virtue receives life from love, and love is gained in love, that is, by raising the eye of our mind to behold how much we are beloved of God. Seeing ourselves loved, we cannot do otherwise than love...So thou seest that we conceive virtues through God and bring them to the birth for our neighbour.\n-- Saint Catherine of Sienna", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 788, "publish_time": "20240619"}

{"cate": ["Howto & Style"], "query": null, "uploader": "Chris Breier", "uploader_id": "@ChrisBreier", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmaYj7TEwB4", "video_id": "wmaYj7TEwB4", "title": "How to Blend Acrylics Like Oils", "description": "Amazon CHAPTERS\nClick on the time stamp to jump to a specific chapter\n0:00 Introduction\n0:15 Using OPEN acrylics or regular acrylics with retarder\n2:00 How to create smooth blends with acrylics\n5:02 Creating soft edges with acrylics\n8:32 How to keep acrylic paint wet on the palette\n9:53 Finishing touches\n10:22 the finished still life painting\n\nIn this video, I demonstrate how to blend acrylics in a manner that's similar to oils. The secret to blending acrylics is to use acrylic retarder to prevent the paint from drying out too soon. I prefer to use Golden OPEN acrylics because the retarder is already mixed into the paint.\n\nI usually blend acrylics after I apply the colors to the canvas. Another tip is to blend the paint with a soft brush. \n\nI also demonstrate how to create soft edges with acrylics. Soft edges have a blurry, out of focus appearance to them. The soft edges make the hard edges stand out more. This is a way to guide the viewers eye to the focal point.\n\nJudging the colors while placing them on a white canvas can be tricky. I find that I have to adjust the values as the painting progresses.\n\nART SUPPLIES & TOOLS USED IN THIS VIDEO\nAll of the links that lead to Blick Art Materials or Amazon are affiliate links. This means that if you click on a link and make a purchase, I earn a commission at no cost to you.\n\nGOLDEN OPEN ACRYLICS\nI used Golden OPEN acrylics for this painting. They're convenient because the retarder is already in the paint, in the proper proportions. The link below contains sets of small tubes of OPEN acrylics so you can try them out, or you can buy the standard sized tubes of individual colors.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5m9\n\nTHE COLORS I USED IN THIS PAINTING\nTitanium White \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcp\nAmazon https://amzn.to/334LyRp\n\nQuinacridone Magenta \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcq\nAmazon https://amzn.to/34rtEt7\n\nUltramarine Blue \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcs\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3f7k9RX\n\nHansa Yellow Opaque \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcu\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3sYSB9w\n\nCarbon Black \nBlick http://shrsl.com/3bvcx\nAmazon https://amzn.to/3qRnNoe\n\nACRYLIC RETARDERS\nYou can add retarder to any brand of acrylics to make them dry slower. This is useful if you already have a brand of acrylics that you prefer. Follow the instructions, you usually don't want to add any more than 25%-30% retarder because it may take too long to dry. The paint may remain tacky even after it dries if you add too much. \n\nGolden Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5mc\nLiquitex Slo-Dri Medium http://shrsl.com/2j5me\nWinsor & Newton Galeria Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5mi\nGrumbacher Artists Acrylic Retarder http://shrsl.com/2j5ml\n\nBRUSHES\nI use mostly synthetic brushes that are made for acrylics like these ones from Robert Simmons\nhttp://shrsl.com/3a082\nThe softer brushes are for watercolor.\n\nACRYLIC PALETTES\nThe Masterson Stay Wet Palette is a large plastic box with a tight fitting lid. It comes with a sponge and palette paper. I find that I don't need the sponge to keep the OPEN acrylics wet, but you may need to use it if you live in a very hot and dry climate. It works better than a Tupperware container because the sides of the wall are lower, and it's large. Here is the 12\"x16\" Masterson Palette I use in the video http://shrsl.com/2j5n4\n\nThis is the smaller palette that I store inside of the Masterson Palette.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5nc\n\nSince the OPEN acrylics stay wet for so long, I never really have to peel the paint off. I just clean it with a wet paper towel or rag. I find the microfiber towels work great.\n\nMICROFIBER TOWELS\nI bought a large package of these on Amazon, the link is below. The small fibers create more surface area than paper towels and they do seem to make it easier to clean things. They work great for drying paint brushes and cleaning palettes. Make sure that you handle them properly if you use them with oil paints because they can spontaneously combust.\nhttps://amzn.to/2GdvMsn\n\nTABLE TOP EASEL\nThis is where you can buy the easel I use in the video:\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5ni\n\nI have been using this table top easel for some time now and I like how portable it is. The top folds down and it has a handle which makes it easy to carry. The drawer on the bottom opens to the side and the inside is divided into separate compartments for storing pencils, brushes, and tubes of paint.\n\nPAINT SPATULA\nThis paint spatula from Princeton is handy tool to have in the studio.\nhttp://shrsl.com/2j5no\n\nCANVAS PANELS\nI've tried out a number or brands of canvas panels, but I'm really fond of the ones made by Raymar. They're acrylic primed and they're backed with a gray melamine that makes them even more resistant to warping.

You know the feeling when you‚Äôre half way through a painting and it isn‚Äôt working out? Maybe it‚Äôs not the values, drawing or the colour - very likely it‚Äôs just that the set up was put together too quickly without a lot of thought.\n\nSo it's really worth takng some time to learn how to set up a still life. Good still life paintings (and most paintings, really) rely on the pattern of lights and darks, and you can create that before you even squeeze out any paint by carefully putting together the still life composition on your stand. If it looks beautiful before you start painting, you have a much better chance of getting a beautiful painting when you‚Äôre finished.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1052, "publish_time": "20210123"}

It produced reasonable power from 1250rpm and crested at around 4500rpm, providing a near perfect torque band before reaching the speed cutoff at 7000rpm. \n\nBecause BMW intended the engine to function reliably and retain the feel of a much larger v8, throttle lag was practically non-existent (for a turbo engine). \n\nThe N55 prefers higher octane gasoline because it provides more power and better efficiency, with most users saying that the expense per mile is the same as when using low octane fuel. \n\nThe N54 and N55 engines were identical in many ways, but the most notable change was that the later N55 model had a contemporary single twinscroll turbine, as opposed to the N54's twin-turbocharger.\n\nA single turbo is less expensive, lighter, and has a few advantages, but the twin-turbo configuration provides more possible power increases from upgrades. However, the benefits of a bigger single twin scroll turbo are still substantial and sufficient for most tuning tasks. Surprisingly, Alpina chose a twin turbo system in their performance versions. Generally, the N55 improved on the N54 and was in production from 2009 to 2015, when it was superseded by the B57 engine. \n\nWith the introduction of the Alpina tuned models we saw the N55 factory power varies from a respectable 302 bhp to 425 bhp and with mapping adjustments it is possible to add around 80hp on the basic engine.\n\nAir Induction kits and Exhaust will NOT usually ADD TORQUE for most stock N55 configurations on their own, but they will allow you to increase power after other improvements by removing the limitation you hit with other mods as the factory setup runs out of capacity to cope. \n\nFlowing and porting the Head - Flowing and porting the head will get air streaming into the engine while eliminating turbulence or limitations. \n\nTurbo upgrades - forced induction is the most important method to increase the air flow to your intake, enabling you to consume more gasoline and gain power. \n\nN55 remapping offers the most power for the money, but new ECUs and integrated Tuning boxes are also options.\n\nChapters\n0:00 Intro\n2:34 Spark Plug Selection\n3:00 Intercoolers\n4:07 Turbo Upgrades\n6:00 Fuel - Port Injection Fuel Types\n6:17 Engine Tuning (Remapping)\n8:08 Induction Kits & Intakes\n9:05 Head Work Gas Flowing Valves\n10:15 Stronger Engine Parts\n11:11 Injector Upgrades\n12:02 Exhaust Mods \n14:20 Forged Crank Pistons\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IG-bqFLaujU?t=181 Intercoolers\n\nThe following cars came with the N55 engine: 2009‚Äì2017 F10/F11/F07 535i, 2010‚Äì2013 E90/E91/E92/E93 335i, 2010‚Äì2013 E82/E88 135i, 2010‚Äì2017 F25 X3 xDrive35i, 2011‚Äì2013 E70 X5 xDrive35i, 2011‚Äì2015 F30/F31 335i, 2011‚Äì2014 E71 X6 xDrive35i, 2012‚Äì2015 E84 X1 xDrive35i, 2013‚Äì2016 F32/F33/F36 435i, 2014‚Äì2018 F15 X5 xDrive35i, 2014‚Äì2019 F16 X6 xDrive35i, and 2014‚Äì2016 F26 X4 xDrive35i.

It was the custom shop behind the first really mainstream car show, Pimp My Ride, and since Pimp My  Ride ended the shop has gone on to be behind another car show named Inside West Coast Customs. \n\nThe shop has a very interesting history too and is probably the one shop in the world that does not have an exact founding date. According to some, the shop was founded way back in 1994, and others say it was 1997.\n\nIn any case, what we do know for sure is that the shop was incorporated in the year 2000 by Ryan Friedlinghaus, a young mechanic who had a passion for building custom made cars. \n\nHowever, Friedlinghaus had discovered quite early in his life that there were almost no garages that could do all everything needed to make a custom car in-house. \n\nSo he created West Coast Customs as a shop that could make custom cars from top to bottom without outsourcing any part of the vehicle. That was his vision for West Coast Customs, and for a while, that was precisely what the shop was. \n\nAt first, the shop did not get a lot of orders, but soon celebrities like Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal started bringing their expensive cars around for custom effects and that is when West Coast Customs blew up.\n\nBefore long, the shop drew the attention of media giants MTV and they pitched the show Pimp My Ride to Friedlinghaus. But here was the catch, Friedlinghaus was not going to be the host of the show. It would merely be hosted in his shop and he would be the one to coordinate the actual work on the vehicles. The real host of the show would be a rapper named Xzibit. \n\nIn the end, Pimp My Ride was a successful show, but after the first few years, West Coast Customs started seeing the first problems that would eventually run the shop out of reality TV shows forever. \n\n#InsideWestCoastCustoms", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 507, "publish_time": "20220627"}

First off, there's not a single Porsche part on the car.\n\nPorsche Engineering Services helped with reengineering the W124's engine compartment to fit in the 32-valve, 4-cam M119 V-8 ‚Äî for both the 400E and the 500E.\n\nBut the 500E doesn't use the same V-8 as the 500SL. It needed shorter connecting rods so that it fit in the same physical space as the 4.2-liter 400E ‚Äî this way only one structural variant needed to be produced.\n\nThe 400E was a response to the Lexus LS400. Why do you think it wasn't called a 420E?\n\nPorsche also did the engineering to bolt up wheels, tires, brakes, and suspension components from the wider and heavier R129 500SL and W124 500SEL. That necessitated fender flares so wide that the 500E didn't fit down the regular W124 production line in Sindelfingen. \n\nFor both models, Porsche performed the physical modifications to Mercedes-built W124 chassis, and sent them back to Sindelfingen for paint. The 400E remained there, but because of its width, the 500E was sent back to Porsche, which assembled the 500E at a second Zuffenhausen factory.\n\nWith Bruno Sacco's revolutionary looks, aerodynamics, obsession with safety, and Mercedes build quality and engineering might, the W124 was certainly among the best (and most expensive) sedans in the world.\n\nStill is. It's close to perfect. But it's not a Porsche Sports Sedan.\n\n=\n\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

If you‚Äôre looking for a simple yet very effective way of losing weight and improving your overall health, walking is something just for you. \nPeople who are physically active throughout their life are much less prone to this disease than those who have a more sedentary lifestyle. And that‚Äôs because they have more volume in their hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning.   \nA daily half-hour walk helps avoid serious problems, like coronary heart disease to name one, by lowering high blood pressure and cholesterol levels and improving blood circulation. Because of better-quality and deeper breathing, some symptoms associated with lung disease can show significant improvement thanks to walking. \nMuscle tone and weight loss is also totally achievable through simple walking. Find your optimal pace, but don‚Äôt break out into a jog. This sort of speed walking is low impact and doesn‚Äôt require any recovery time, which means no sore muscles to keep you from getting out and walking the next day.\nThe Arthritis Foundation recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate walking a day to reduce pain, stiffness, and inflammation in the joints. Building strong bones will help you prevent osteoporosis and reduce bone loss. Walking contributes to better blood circulation within the spinal structures, pumping important nutrients into the soft tissues and improving posture and flexibility, both of which are vital for a healthy spine.\nA group of researchers at Iowa State University worked with hundreds of college students. Walking changed their mood for the better, even though no one warned them it could do so.\nIf you still don‚Äôt feel motivated enough to start walking for your health, try joining a class or find a buddy who also wouldn‚Äôt mind getting all the benefits of walking. Another idea could be to hire a personal trainer.\n\nMusic: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music\n\nTIMESTAMPS\nBrain-boosting effect 0:45\nImproved eyesight 1:44\nPrevention of heart disease 2:47\nIncreased lung volume 3:14\nBenefits for the pancreas 3:51\nImproved digestion 4:23\nToned muscles 4:59\nSturdier bones and joints 5:45\nBack pain relief 6:10\nA calmer mind 7:04\nBonus: the FIT formula 8:00\n\nSUMMARY\n-Walking prevents the early onset of dementia, reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and improves your overall mental well-being by reducing stress and releasing endorphins.\n-Get on the road to improve vision and protect your eyes now from potential problems, such as glaucoma, in the future. \n-Walking is no less effective than running when it comes to the prevention of heart disease and stroke.\n-Walking is an aerobic exercise, which means that it increases oxygen flow in the bloodstream and helps eliminate toxins and waste, which is great for your lungs. \n-Walking for exercise is a surprisingly more effective way to prevent diabetes than running is.\n-Just half an hour of walking every day not only lowers the risk of developing colon cancer but also improves digestion and regulates bowel movements.\n-Just 10,000 steps a day can be just as effective as a full-blown workout at the gym, especially if you add some intervals or uphill walking.\n-Walking can provide more joint mobility, prevent the loss of bone density, and even reduce the risk of fractures.\n-Walking is a real life-saver for those who experience back pain during more challenging high-impact exercises.\n-Walking improves depression symptoms in patients with MDD, just imagine how easily it could help us cope with just feeling down or exhausted.\n-Keep in mind the FIT formula.

However, is this a valid perspective? Well, to determine if heavy and light weight training cause different effects, we need to look at the research. After reviewing the research out there, it seems that using heavy or light weights actually doesn‚Äôt matter much in terms of hypertrophy. Studies show that muscle growth tends to be equal despite using light weights or heavy weights (high rep vs low rep). But this is only true when going to near failure, and one benefit of lifting heavy weights is the better strength gains you see when compared to light weights. Based on this, as you‚Äôll see in my video, your best bet is to incorporate high reps with light weights AND low reps with heavy weights into your workout. This will enable you to target both metabolic stress and mechanical tension; both are important mechanisms of muscle growth. \n\nLIGHT WEIGHTS VS HEAVY WEIGHTS ARTICLE:\nhttps://builtwithscience.com/light-weights-heavy-weights/ \n\n You can browse around my website and read the articles I do have up (I‚Äôll be adding more articles on a regular basis).

Dr. Mandell", "description": "Engaging in calf pumps while seated offers an array of health benefits that extend far beyond simple leg exercise. Firstly, this activity significantly enhances circulation by utilizing the \"muscle pump\" mechanism. When the calf muscles contract, they compress the veins running through them, effectively pushing blood upward towards the heart. The one-way valves in these veins prevent the blood from flowing back down, ensuring efficient venous return and reducing the risk of blood pooling, swelling, and conditions like varicose veins. Improved circulation means that oxygen and nutrients are more effectively delivered throughout the body, supporting overall cellular function and health.\n\nAdditionally, calf pumps play a crucial role in blood sugar regulation. The muscle contractions increase glucose uptake from the bloodstream into the muscle cells, where it is used for energy, thereby helping to lower blood sugar levels. This process also improves insulin sensitivity, meaning the body requires less insulin to manage blood glucose levels effectively. Enhanced insulin sensitivity is particularly beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, as it helps to maintain more stable blood sugar levels and reduces the risk of postprandial glucose spikes.\n\nMoreover, calf pumps can significantly aid in digestion. The improved circulation ensures that digestive organs receive a better supply of oxygen and nutrients, which enhances their functionality. The physical activity also stimulates the autonomic nervous system, promoting peristalsis‚Äîthe wave-like contractions that move food through the digestive tract. This helps to prevent common digestive issues such as bloating and constipation, leading to more efficient digestion and nutrient absorption.\n\nIncorporating regular calf pumps while seated can also help reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition that can occur during prolonged periods of inactivity, such as long flights or desk jobs. By promoting blood flow and reducing stasis in the veins, calf pumps serve as a preventative measure against this potentially serious condition. Additionally, improved lymphatic circulation facilitated by these exercises aids in the removal of metabolic waste products, contributing to overall better health and reduced inflammation.\n\nIn summary, the simple act of performing calf pumps while seated offers numerous health benefits, including enhanced circulation, improved blood sugar regulation and insulin sensitivity, better digestion, and protection against conditions like DVT. This easy-to-implement activity is a powerful tool for maintaining and improving overall health, especially for individuals who spend extended periods sitting.\n\n****************************************************\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

This video provides information about the cerebellum connection.  All balancing exercises in this video are inspired by the book ADHD 2.0 by Edward Hallowell and John Ratey.  The balancing exercises in this video target the cerebellum and the vestibular system of the inner ear. These two areas combined are referred to as the vestibulo cerebellar system.  Compelling evidence from research citings in this book suggest that strengthening this system not only improves physical skill but also attention and focus and emotional regulation. Chapter three of this book goes into detail regarding the cerebellum connection. What interested me the most about this connection is the affect of calming emotions.  I've personally tried balancing exercises with children who struggle with emotional dysregulation and I've seen first had how the balancing is used as a \"bottom up\" regulation tool that younger children can access to help bring balance to an emotionally hijacked brain. Since their frontal lobes are so underdeveloped (the frontal lobes are used for \"top down\" regulation techniques), this is an exciting intervention for them to experience.  The book introduces the concept of stimulating the cerebellum through balance to regulate emotions and increase focus and attention. Since reading ADHD 2.0 I have introduced all the children and teens I work with to balancing exercises and I made this video for them to practice over the summer and outside of school hours.  This is just an introduction to some of the most popular balancing activities.

This all happens in the blink of an eye. Even at a younger age you will see people who play sports can do this much faster and land much more safely than people who do not play sport. This is a skill that can be trained and needs constant exposure to maintain it's fast response. A very slow response is what you see with an older person who has not spent time developing skills of balance, agility and power. The chance of a injury from a fall is very likely. \n\n\nMost of the current core workouts is all about training abdominal muscles in isolation using crunches, planks, and various other floor based exercises. The belief here is that if you train your core like you would with a bicep curl to make a bicep stronger, you will have improved balance and function. Unfortunately it does not work this way at all. For starters there is no need for fast reflex reactions as you are already on the floor. Secondly, planks and other traditional abdominal exercises are of little use to the older adult and more likely to cause more harm than good for these exercises are all about stiffness and rigidity. The older adult already has too much stiffness and rigidity, they do not need more.\n\nThe key is in using exercises that demand a reflex response that can teach them more effective ways to restore balance and stability.\n\nWe know the amazing benefits of agility training with sports for improving reaction times and reflex skills. The same is true for older adults but instead of improved sporting performance we may be able to save their life!\n\nStatistics in the US show that one adult over the age of 65 is treated in the emergency room for a fall every 18 seconds (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Quite an alarming statistic and even more scary when you consider that hip fractures are the most common injury from a fall and the number one cause of nursing home admission. Approximately 50% of those who suffer a hip fracture never fully regain their mobility and independence, and 50% of those die within the first year! Falling for an older adult is a very serious matter, and a life threatening situation. \n\nOther great articles to read about this subject are below\n\nStability Training What Is It Really & How To Do It\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/246-stability-training-what-is-it-really-why-is-it-so-important\n\nStrength Training For Older Adults\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/179-can-you-slow-the-ageing-process-with-exercise\n\nReduce Arthritis & Improve Bone Density\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/214-how-to-reduce-arthritis-symptoms-improve-overall-bone-density\n\nAnd if you live in Melbourne and would like to know more about our specific Older Adults Strength Training program go to our website in the link below\nhttps://www.noregretspt.com.au/index.php/resources/blog/43-2014/187-stronger-for-longer-older-adults-training", "quality": "1440x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20190221"}

You see, the core is generally made up of four key components. Namely - the rectus abdominus (6pack / lower abs), obliques, the serratus anterior, and the transverse abdominus (inner abs).\n\nüëâCoaching Programs: https://www.fraserwilsonfitness.com\n\nThe obliques are an absolute must when it comes to developing an aesthetic physique. If your goal is to attain the V tapered look, there‚Äôs no way around training them. The obliques are a multifunctional muscle, they act to pull the chest downwards and compress the abdominal cavity, as well as performing side bending and opposing side rotation. Overall, you can‚Äôt skimp on your obliques for aesthetic and performance, and the best way to ensure that you stay on track is to keep your workouts fresh & challenging\n\nThe serratus is a muscle that originates on your upper rib cage and attaches to the media border of the shoulder blade (basically the shark gill looking things). The serratus muscles play a pivotal role in framing out your abs, obliques and lower pec. Not too mention, it absolutely serves as an asset to the v taper, in turn giving you a better looking set of abs!\n\nThis video is full length which means you can just follow along with whatever I'm doing.

You've come to the right place!\n\n\n---\n\n\nWhy do you get so sore after leg day?\n\n\nWe know that our muscles get sore when we work them hard, whether that‚Äôs through lifting heavy weights, doing tons of reps, or burning them out through long or intense cardio.\n\n\nBut why do legs get more sore than your other muscles? \n\n\nThe simple answer is that there are many muscles in your legs, and they‚Äôre quite large‚Ä¶ which means it‚Äôs a lot harder for them to recover.\n\n\nThere are two different kinds of muscle soreness you should be aware of.\n\n\nThe first kind of muscle soreness is acute, or immediate soreness. As you challenge your muscles, they build up lactic acid, which is what causes the familiar ‚Äúburning sensation‚Äù you get right before your muscles fail.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs this quick onset soreness that you feel in the gym, between sets, or right after you finish your workout.\n\n\nIt typically won‚Äôt last more than a few minutes, or at worst, a few hours after you finish working out.\n\n\nThe second kind of muscle soreness, and the kind that can make leg day miserable, is delayed soreness, often called DOMS or Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.\n\n\nDOMS is exactly what it sounds like, and it explains why your legs are so sore the next day or two after a tough leg workout.\n\n\nOn a physiological level, the process of lifting weights and building muscle involves causing lots of microscopic tears in your muscle fibers. When these tears are repaired through rest, nutrition, and recovery, you build new muscle and gain strength.\n\n\nBut in the meantime, it can hurt‚Ä¶ a lot! The micro-tears in your muscles will swell, become inflamed, and cause you some pain while they‚Äôre recovering.\n\n\nMost experts believe DOMS are worse in your legs because of the large size of the muscle groups, and the fact that you‚Äôll lift heavier loads than you would during, say, a bicep curl.\n\n\nSo now that you understand a little bit of the science behind leg soreness, you know that it‚Äôs totally normal, and is often a sign of a great workout!\n\n\nBut what can you do to ease that soreness? Here are 5 tips that might help.\n----\n1. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate\n\n\nThis is a good idea on almost any day, but it counts double for recovering from leg day.\n\n\nMake sure you hydrate plenty before, during, and after your workout, as well as in the days following it while you recover.\n\n\nProper hydration helps your muscles heal and delivers nutrients to the parts of your body that need it the most.\n\n\nThere‚Äôs no hard and fast rule for this, but you‚Äôll sometimes see health experts recommend the 8 by 8 approach ‚Äî that‚Äôs eight 8 ounce glasses of water every day.\n---\n\n\n2. Stretch out those quads and hammies!\n\n\nMost people know the importance of properly warming up, but just as important (and probably even more likely to be skipped) is a good cool-down session.\n\n\nAfter squats or deadlifts, you‚Äôll probably be exhausted and ready to go home. But if you‚Äôre having major leg soreness or trouble walking, it‚Äôs probably worth taking a few minutes to stretch after your leg day workout.\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to go overboard, just get a nice deep stretch on your major leg muscles before you call it a day. If it‚Äôs too late and you‚Äôre already home and feeling sore, a good stretch will still help blood flow and recovery in those muscle groups.\n---\n\n\n3. Walk, do yoga, or hit the stationary bike \n\n\nEven though you might be in pain, sitting on the couch doing nothing is probably not the right way to go.\n\n\nGetting back to the gym, if possible, and doing some light work on the stationary bike is PERFECT for leg recovery. It‚Äôs low impact, easy, and will promote great circulation.\n\n\nA gentle yoga class or a long walk are also great options.\n\n\nIt might hurt at first if your legs are really sore, but it should help alleviate the pain sooner than remaining sedentary would.\n---\n\n\n4. Ice those legs down\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre having a brutal leg day hangover, it‚Äôs because you did some serious damage to your muscles on a microscopic level. (Congrats on a great workout, by the way!)\n\n\nAs we talked about above, those little tears and abrasions are going to swell up and feel awful in the process of healing.\n\n\nSo what do you do when something swells up? You ice it down!\n\n\nAn ice pack on your legs will actually narrow the blood vessels and reduce the blood flow to the area, which will help the swelling go down and get you back on your feet.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not ideal for nutrient delivery and recovery, but it will help ease the pain.\n---\n\n\n5. Use a foam roller\n\n\nFoam rollers are a FANTASTIC accessory that can help you work out knots in your muscles, improve mobility, avoid injuries, and promote better recovery after workouts.\n\n\nWhen all else fails and the soreness is just too deep in your muscles, and especially if you‚Äôre having trouble walking, using one of these can really help loosen you back up.\n\n\nLook up a few foam rolling exercises that target your legs and pay careful attention to the technique to get the best results.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20221115"}

Dr. Mandell", "description": "Utilizing a towel as a simple yet effective tool can significantly enhance foot and leg circulation, particularly after a rigorous workout session. Following a day filled with exercises that engage the lower body, a towel can be employed for gentle stretching and massaging, which can help alleviate discomfort and promote better blood flow. To begin, you might sit comfortably on the floor or on a chair or sofa, draping the towel around the arch of your foot while holding the ends. Gently pulling the towel towards you will provide a safe stretch for the calf muscles and Achilles tendon, aiding flexibility and circulation. This stretch not only helps in loosening tight muscles but also encourages venous return, reducing the risk of developing varicose veins and minimizing swelling in the ankles and feet.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating rhythmic movements with the towel can further enhance circulation. For instance, you can perform a \"towel scrunch,\" where you place a towel on the floor and use your toes to scrunch it up towards you. This exercise engages the small muscles in the feet, stimulating blood flow and strengthening foot muscles, thus promoting overall leg health. Using the towel as a prop in various exercises, such as leg extensions or lateral leg raises, can facilitate a greater range of motion and improve circulation in the legs. By engaging in these practices regularly, you not only support your muscle recovery post-workout but also cultivate a habit that promotes long-term circulation health, helping to keep your legs feeling light and energized! Remember, integrating such mindful practices into your routine can significantly impact your overall well-being, helping to prevent discomfort and enhance the vitality of your lower extremities.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

As my library of animation tutorials has expanded it's been necessary to re-structure and expand the principles into my own list of 21 'Foundations'. Keep using the 12 if it suits you, but as a teaching device I find the 21 to be far more comprehensive.\n\nRead the full essay (link above) for more detail. I'm also going to create individual movies covering each of the 21 foundations, with links to my Lynda/Linkedin-Learning courses, so that a student can focus on each foundation more efficiently.\n\nFollow this link for a free 30 day trial of linkedin-learning:\nhttps://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/1810945/469502/8005\n\n*\n\nEcho by Broken Elegance üé© https://soundcloud.com/brokenelegance\nCreative Commons ‚Äî Attribution 3.0 Unported  ‚Äî CC BY 3.0 \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/_MyowPoOUgk", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 580, "publish_time": "20190115"}

As my library of animation tutorials has expanded it's been necessary to re-structure and expand the principles into my own list of 21 'Foundations'. Keep using the 12 if it suits you, but as a teaching device I find the 21 to be far more comprehensive.\n\nRead the full essay (link above) for more detail.
