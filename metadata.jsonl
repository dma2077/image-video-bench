My self portrait sculpture did begin a little rocky due to my air drying clay being rock solid because I had it in the studio for so long, however once the water was added it was plain sailing! Now I did have higher hopes for my self portrait sculpture, but as time went on I realised that it was definitely going to be an abstract clay sculpture rather than a hyper realistic one. The final step to making this self portrait sculpture resemble my own face in the slightest was to paint in..... and of course more problems ensued. But my last minute thinking about my self portrait sculpture made of air drying clay being transported through a different dimension definitely rescued it and the end result was of course perfection..... But let me know what your thoughts were on my self portrait sculpture, and if you'd like me to make anything else out of air drying clay.\n\n#SelfPortrait #Sculpture #Clay\n‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ\n\nRecommended Videos:\nI Let A Wheel Pick My Crafts: https://youtu.be/b-ExgLSGNrw\nDIY Spin Art: https://youtu.be/uH50T1WJGUc\nPainting The British Countryside: https://youtu.be/uN2au1-pRGQ\nDIY String Art: https://youtu.be/SsdnZQVW15k\nPour Painting Techniques: https://youtu.be/buqPziEBF2Q\nHot Glue Gun Crafts: https://youtu.be/QxrYOfNKSaI\nGoing Through My Old Art Portfolio: https://youtu.be/q41BNuWOsTI\nSelf Portrait Painting: https://youtu.be/KzQZ0Wfh1eU\n\n‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ‚¶æ\nAbout my channel:\nMy names Anthony Crammen, an artist based in the UK, and my Youtube channel focuses on arts and crafts, DIY projects, various attempts at Pinterest projects, creative product testing and reviews, and everything creative!

That was until I tried this Canon Powershot G9 from 2007 - so much about this camera makes it a joy to shoot with. It pairs more 'pro' features of Canons DSLRs with a compact yet bulky body, it's not a compact that you lose very easily and has surprisingly useful ergonomics. For street photography, sometimes we're too busy with full-featured mirrorless cameras and foolproof telephoto lenses - it's important that we give equal time to more limited cameras like this. Street photography is an interesting genre that often asks you to approach the street in different ways to find what's working for you. Unlike a Leica, a Lumix LX100, a Fujifilm X100V or a Sony A7C this Powershot G9 doesn't offer heaps of flexibility, instead, it asks you to assess your position and make the most of the gear in your hand.\n\nCheck out MPB here and grab a used camera deal!\n\nMPB UK: https://prf.hn/l/QLBLRLl\nMPB US: https://prf.hn/l/y8b8X8w\nMPB EU: https://prf.hn/l/BJ1JqJo\n\nüéûÔ∏è Shop My Presets: https://georgeholden.media/store\n\nüéÅ Newsletter Sign Up (2 Free Presets When You Sign Up): https://www.georgeholden.media/newsletter\n\n--------------\n\nYou might be interested in these: \nWebsite: https://www.georgeholden.media/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/georgeholdenmedia/\nEmail: partnerships@georgeholden.media\n\nSome of the above links are affiliate links, by purchasing via these links I receive a small commission.\n\n--------------", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 652, "publish_time": "20230309"}

An overabundance of detail or a lack of tonal contrast can often create confusion within an illustration, or worse, flatten it out completely.\n\nIn this comic art critique I‚Äôll be discussing the importance of balancing tonal contrast and details to create depth within black and white line art, and how to emphasize the key points of focus within a given composition. \n\nTo illustrate these points, I‚Äôll be doing a draw over of an art piece from Korey Barton‚Äôs second issue of Kozor ( read issue #1 of Kozor here: https://www.howtodrawcomics.net/kozor-1 ). \n\nThis particular comic book illustration incorporates an overwhelming amount of intricacy into a visually stunning composition. \n\nBut there‚Äôs an issue.\n\nTonal contrast isn‚Äôt present between the main subjects within the illustration, resulting in a lack of emphasis and visual disorientation. The details that have been incorporated into the illustration also aren‚Äôt dispersed in a way that accurately suggests the forms under the established lighting conditions. \n\nAs I address these errors throughout the illustration, we‚Äôll focus on introducing additional depth, giving the characters more pop, and carefully re-balancing the details for increased readability. \n\nI hope you enjoy the video! \n\nThanks for watching! \n-Clayton\n\nSoftware Used: Photoshop\n\nIf you like the video, show your support by commenting, sharing or subscribing. \n\nComic Art Community - https://www.howtodrawcomics.net/comic-art-community/\nHow to Draw Comics .NET - http://www.howtodrawcomics.net/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/howtodrawcomics/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/howtodrawcomics\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/howtodrawcomics\nTumblr - http://howtodrawcomics.tumblr.com/\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/howtodrawcomics/", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 515, "publish_time": "20190424"}

It depicts three monkeys covering their eyes, ears, and mouth, respectively. This image is often used to represent the proverb \"See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.\"\nThe three monkeys symbolize:\nSee no evil: This represents avoiding seeing or witnessing negativity or harmful actions.\nHear no evil: This represents avoiding hearing or listening to negative or harmful words.\nSpeak no evil: This represents avoiding speaking negatively or harmfully.\nGandhiji adopted this symbol as a powerful way to promote non-violence and self-control. He believed that by following these principles, individuals could contribute to a more peaceful and harmonious society. The three monkeys have become a widely recognized symbol of these values around the world.\nfrom where this concept came\nThe concept of the Three Monkeys is believed to have originated in ancient Japan. It is often associated with the Buddhist concept of \"three poisons\" ‚Äì greed, hatred, and ignorance. These three vices are considered to be the root causes of suffering.\nThe three monkeys are thought to represent a way to overcome these poisons:\nSee no evil: Overcoming greed and desire.\nHear no evil: Overcoming hatred and anger.\nSpeak no evil: Overcoming ignorance and delusion.\nGandhiji adopted this concept and incorporated it into his philosophy of non-violence. He saw it as a powerful tool for personal and societal transformation.\nwhat about three monkeys of japan\nThe three monkeys of Japan, often referred to as \"Mizaru, Kikazaru, Iwazaru,\" are a popular symbol of non-violence and self-control. They are depicted covering their eyes, ears, and mouth, respectively, representing the proverb \"See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.\"\nThe exact origin of the three monkeys is uncertain, but it is believed to have originated in Japan during the Edo period (1603-1867). The concept may have been influenced by Buddhist teachings, particularly the three poisons of greed, hatred, and ignorance.\nSignificance:\nNon-violence: The three monkeys symbolize the importance of avoiding negativity and harmful actions, words, and thoughts.\nSelf-control: They represent the ability to control one's senses and impulses.\nHarmony: By following the principles of the three monkeys, individuals can contribute to a more peaceful and harmonious society.\nCultural Impact:\nThe three monkeys have become a popular symbol in Japanese culture and have been incorporated into various forms of art, literature, and folklore. They are often found in shrines, temples, and public spaces.\nHere are some philosophical approaches to this question:\n\nMoral relativism: This approach states that there are no absolute, universal moral truths. What is considered right or wrong depends on the cultural or social context. For example, in some cultures, polygamy may be considered acceptable, while in others it is considered taboo.\nMoral absolutism: This approach argues that there are absolute, universal moral principles that apply to everyone regardless of cultural or social context. These principles are often thought to be divinely inspired or based on reason and logic.\nVirtue ethics: This approach focuses on developing good character traits such as honesty, kindness, and courage. Virtuous individuals are more likely to make morally correct choices.\nDeontology: This theory emphasizes duty and obligation. It suggests that moral actions are those that are motivated by a sense of duty, regardless of the outcome.\nUtilitarianism: This approach focuses on the consequences of actions. It argues that the morally right action is the one that produces the most happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people.\n\nUltimately, the question of what is right and what is wrong is a very personal question. Each person must grapple with these philosophical concepts and develop their own moral compass.\n\nWould you like to explore any of these philosophical perspectives in more detail?", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 481, "publish_time": "20240830"}

Before I start, you need to do two specific things for your car. One is to ensure it's clean, which is one of the easiest things you can do to boost your car's appearance. Next, make sure it doesn't smell like ass. No matter what car you drive, if it stinks like butt, it's a turn-off. I use Drift, which is a sister company to Scentbird. It's not made of synthetic, toxic chemicals. They use natural essential oils, which I'm using teak, which smells insane and connects with a magnet you can slip on your visor. And then clip it. It's made of a simple, sustainable block of wood. That said, here are the essentials you need in your car:\nPen and paper. You always need these to write things down while you're in your car.\n\nTube of Vaseline. It's the best and can double as a moisturizer if your hands are dry. You can also dab it around your eyes. Other lip balms will melt and get nasty.\n\nGrooming kit. Buy or assemble a kit with essentials such as scissors, tweezers, and clippers.\n\nKnife. You can get a knife with a glass break on the back. This could also be used in case of an accident.\n\nUmbrella. You want to ensure you're still looking good even in the rain.\n\nGum. You need to have fresh breath.\n\nPack of tissues. These are great to have on hand for various reasons, including crying, runny noses, and spills.\n\nSunglasses. Always keep an extra pair in your car.\n\nTire inflator. Mine is from the brand Slime. It's a mini tire inflator and has come in handy.\n\nBag + Box. My essentials bag contains extra coins (change), hand sanitizer, toothbrush, toothpaste, aspirin, Tylenol, butt wipes, and dental floss. My box contains a light jacket, first aid kit, gloves, towel, and running shoes.\n\nHeadphones. I like to keep these in the car in case I forget mine.\n\nFlashlight. It's essential for nighttime issues. Mine's from a company called Coast.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 619, "publish_time": "20240509"}

This groups is mainly made up of farmers and farm workers. \n\nWe first look at social hierarchy. There's a common misconception that Egyptians were divided by their occupations. For example, a pyramid might be ordered: Pharaoh, Government Officials (Vizier/Priests/Nobles), Soldiers, Scribes, Merchants, Artisans, Craftsmen, Farmers, Construction Workers, Serfs, Slaves.\n\nNext we look at why the Nile river was so essential to Egypt's prosperity.\nMost farmers lived by the Nile river and used it daily so it was extremely important.\n\nThe work life of farmers is fascinating, so we spend a decent chunk of time seeing how farming worked in ancient Egypt. See the tools and process Egyptians used to farm and grow their crops.\n\nAfter this we walk through a reconstructed ancient Egyptian house. You'll see all of the rooms and furniture that was typical in a home at the time. Their pets were also important, so dogs and cats are briefly mentioned.\n\nNext we look at the ancient Egyptian diet. The staples were beer and bread. Wheat derived products were the basis of all meals. See what an Egyptian would eat from day to day in a full day of eating.\n\nFollowing the Egyptian  menu, we take a look a what happens when an Egyptian dies. Life expectancies and causes of death are not a fun subject, but the process of death was a massive part of ancient Egyptian culture.\n\nOn a lighter note, we finish off with family and free time. Much of life was spent on a farm working, but family was always the main focus of an Egyptian. What kids did in their spare time isn't really too different to what kids did today.\n\nIn summary, this is a complete look at what daily life of an Egyptian was really like.", "quality": "1920x960", "duration": 1428, "publish_time": "20200429"}

Because when it comes to matters of the heart, Babyface has turned our angst, our triumphs, our devastation, into timeless love songs that have scored the romances of more than one generation.\n\nJoined by top-tier talent ‚Äî Tank, Chant√© Moore and Avery Wilson ‚Äî Babyface came out swinging. From the songs that put him on the map, to those he wrote or produced for other icons, around the room hit after hit was met with swoons, sighs and not a few tears. (Ok, maybe that was just me.)\n\nBabyface is a titan of the music industry: with numerous top 10 hits, 12 Grammys (50 nominations) and a jaw-dropping roster of collaborations. In 2022, he assembled a stellar ensemble of women for one of my favorite albums of the year, Girls Night Out. To watch this master of pen and sound behind the Tiny Desk was truly epic and nothing short of a dream come true.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Two Occasions\"\n\"Whip Appeal\"\n\"Superwoman\"\n\"Take A Bow\"\n\"Not Gon' Cry\"\n\"Can We Talk\"\n\"Change the World\"\n\"Thnks fr th Mmrs\"\n\"I'll Make Love To You\"\n\"End Of The Road\"\n\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nKenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds: vocals, keys, guitar \nErskine Hawkins III: keys, music director\nAntoine Porter: guitar \nWalt Barnes Jr.: bass\nReggie Regg: drums \nTank: vocals \nChant√© Moore: vocals \nAvery Wilson: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter \nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna \nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Hazel Cills\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #babyface", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1782, "publish_time": "20230609"}

Waiting to switch to a better quality paper later will be much like learning to paint all over again.\n\nMY PALETTE: All tube paints!\nWinsor Newton- Yellow Ochre, Sepia, Burnt Sienna, Winsor Red, Davy's Gray, Ultramarine, Sap Green. \nDaVinci - Phthalo Blue, Quinachridone Fuchsia, Cadmium Yellow Lemon, Cadmium Yellow Deep.\nA note on Davy's Gray: I rarely use this pigment straight and when using it I usually mix it with each colour used.\n\nPAINT PALETTE::\nThe palette is the mixing tray from a \"Koi\" Watercolour travel set. The colours are set up so the ones I mix together most often are close together.\nThe paints are squeezed onto slips of paper and then stuck to the palette.\nThis makes replacing or changing colours quick and easy.\n\nBRUSH: A Polar Flo 1/2 inch Flat Brush\n\nA metal Palette Knife.\n\nREFERENCE IDEA: came from my imagination/memory.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 595, "publish_time": "20181201"}

With the use of three Pantone colors and two printing plates, we show how overlapping the colors in a design can create striking and unique results. This behind the scenes video also shows how we set up our press and register our colors. Follow along to see this press in action! We‚Äôll be using Pantone Yellow 012, Pantone 806 Neon Pink, and Pantone 801 Fluorescent Blue! The combination of these colors can produce an incredible effect.\n\nThis turn of the century press dates back to 1912 when it was manufactured in Ohio based on the original patent from 1899. It‚Äôs a Gordon Style letterpress with one of the largest printable areas manufactured at that time. Using all new ink rollers and some elbow grease, we brought this press back to life and have been using it to print and die-cut some of our most challenging print projects yet. Hand feeding each sheet helps us keep a close eye on color, registration, and quality which helps us produce the finest work possible.\n\nWe hope to engage with creatives all over the world to promote challenging and inspiring designs. If you are a designer working in print and have a concept that pushes the limits‚Ä¶ please reach out! We always enjoy collaborating with talented industry leaders to further the craft of letterpress!\n\nBy sharing these videos, we hope to help artists and creatives learn more about the process behind our printing and create a community where print design will flourish.

Because while a lot of us are familiar with some of the more obvious effects in terms of our cardiovascular health and general fitness, there are some incredible, lesser-known benefits that make aerobic exercise an essential component of our overall health and wellness.\n\nAnd to give you some additional support in terms of incorporating more aerobic exercise into your routine this week, I‚Äôm also going to give you some quick and simple tips on routines and activities you can do to get started. Particularly ones that are very time efficient and effective.\n\nThe Top Health Benefits of Aerobic Exercise (0:44)\n\n#1 Helps Build a Stronger Immune System\n\nMost guys don‚Äôt know that consistent aerobic exercise is research-proven to keep your immune system strong and help your body ward off common illnesses like the flu or a cold.\n\n#2 Great Way to Burn Fat\n\nAerobics also increase your fat-burning capacity ‚Äì long after you‚Äôre done exercising: By regularly doing aerobic exercise, your muscles develop a higher number of mitochondria, which help you burn more fat at rest ‚Äì even when you‚Äôre not exercising.\n\n#3 Correlated with a Longer Lifespan\n\nAerobics help you live longer: According to the newest scientific research, those who engage in aerobic exercise live longer than those who do not.\n\n#4 Helps Improve Your Brain Function\n\nAerobics makes you smarter: New research also shows that aerobics increases your brain‚Äôs production of a molecule called Irisin that improves memory and protects our brains against degeneration.\n\n#5 Improves Cardiovascular Health\n\nAerobics makes your heart stronger: Aerobics train your heart to beat more efficiently, so your heart doesn‚Äôt have to work as hard. \n\nThat‚Äôs why aerobically fit people have lower heart rates than non-fit people. In fact, elite athletes often have resting heart rates as low as 40 beats per minute (the average man over 40 is 90bpm).\n\n#6 Decreases Chance of Disease\n\nAerobics ward off most major health risks: Studies also show that aerobics helps reduce your risk of diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure.\n\nHow to Get Started With Aerobic Exercise (4:20)\n\nNow, after understanding these top benefits of aerobic exercise, it‚Äôs also important to look at the best practice for aerobic exercise. Because for those of us with busy schedules, it can be pretty difficult to fit in an hour or two each day of light jogging or running on the treadmill to get these benefits. But thankfully, as you‚Äôll discover in this video, there is a much more time-efficient way to get started with aerobic exercise and still see the amazing effects.\n\n#1 Daily Walking\n#2 Regular Cardio\n#3 Strength & Cardio Circuit Training\n\nSo I hope this guide leaves you with some added motivation to incorporate more aerobic exercise into your routine, and some simple ideas on how to get started. Because once you do, I think you‚Äôll find that aerobic exercise is an essential part of creating the healthy lifestyle you‚Äôre working towards, and it doesn‚Äôt have to eat up a ton of time to make it happen.\n\nIf you feel your lifestyle could use an improvement, then check out our FF30X 30-Day Transformation Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-ff30x-program\nIf you want to start putting on muscle TODAY, check out our Fit Father Old School Muscle Building Program at ‚Üí https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-osm-program\n\nYour friends here at the FFP, \n\n-Dr. Balduzzi + The Men's Health Experts @ The Fit Father Project\n\n**Disclaimer: This information is for reference purposes ONLY and cannot replace personal information you can and should discuss with your Doctor.

Please note that before you engage in stress reliever dance movements, make sure that you are in good physical condition. It is best to consult your doctor or physical therapist before getting really intense in DanceFitDaddy Workouts.\n\nBecause there are different levels of difficulty for each individual, below are some guidelines to check before participating in this kind of high intensity dance cardio workout for weight loss:\n\n1. It is best to dance at your highest possible intensity to reap the benefits of DanceFitDaddy exercises. However, don't take it too far that you will have difficulty catching your breath. You are properly doing a cardio dance workout for weight loss if you cannot say any three-word sentence. However, it should not make you feel weak or make you lose consciousness. \n\n2. It is important to move to your highest range of motion to maximize the toning of your muscles. Stretch it as far as you to have the full benefit of the happy sweat dance workout. However, check that your joints can handle the intensity and speed of the dance therapy exercises, movements like joint rotations, bends, and sudden strikes. Take it easy if it is too much for you.\n\n3. It is fun to dance in different styles and patterns to make your dance therapy for fitness an enjoyable experience each and every time. However, please be careful not to follow steps that could lose your balance or make you dizzy, like turning, running, jumping, and other fast or sudden movements. Adjust the intensity of the cardio workout routine by making small controlled steps.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 459, "publish_time": "20220621"}

With our blindfolds on, we were unable to realize the pain we were causing each other. The moment our blindfolds came off, we understood how crucial communication is.  As long as anything is said with consideration of each other‚Äôs feelings, then the truth will bring you closer. \n\n\nchoreography: sean lew\ndanced by: sean lew & kaycee rice \nsong: Silence ft.

Find out more: https://aki-anyway-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nIn this video I talk about how to cartoonize people and how you can make anyone into a cartoon. I start with the basics, how to recognize the shapes and proportions of the person you want to draw, and then I break the process down step by step.\nI show how you can draw simplified eyes, noses, mouths, hair and the whole face shape! This way you'll be able to cartoon yourself, a celebrity, or anyone you want. \nAt the end of the video there is a time-lapse drawing that shows my process of drawing in my own style, a bit more complex cartoon style.\n\nHope you find the video useful!

All useful qualities to have when you need a motivation boost!\n\n- Shaking and releasing movements: Shaking the body and movements of release are very useful at regulating the body and releasing tension.\n\n- Visualization exercise: fake it until you make it! Visualization is extremely helpful in helping you embody your transformation and identify important limiting beliefs you may have. This particular exercise allows you to symbolically connect with a particular goal or desire and go through the process of actually achieving it, despite the obstacles you may face. Celebrating your achievements also helps increase your confidence and believe in your capabilities.

Her artistic practice is also inspired by the experience of having lived both in the USA and in Nigeria, the homeland of her parents. Ogunji lived in Lagos for a period in 2011 in connection with an artist‚Äôs residency. During her stay she created a number of works that explored the city‚Äôs urban landscape and environment, women‚Äôs role in Nigerian society, and the culture and mythology of the Yoruba people. These themes also appear in her later work. The works shown in the exhibition are embroidered with colourful thread on translucent tracing paper onto which she then applies ink, graphite or acrylic paints, creating contrasts between the delicate and the rough.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 350, "publish_time": "20200724"}

He has received a World of Dance Award in 2016 for Male Choreographer of the Year, an Industry Voice Awards in 2011 for Best Choreography in a Music Video for Britney Spears \"Till the World Ends\", the Choreographers Carnival London Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006, an MTV Video Music Awards for Best Choreography in a Music Video for Fatboy Slim \"Weapon of Choice\" (Assistant Choreographer to Michael Rooney), and in earlier years, a Recognition Awards for Dancers for Best Auditioner.\nHaving worked on some of the most sought after jobs in the business, his film credits include ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äôs Angels: Full Throttle‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou Got Served‚Äù, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs All That‚Äù, ‚ÄúAustin Powers Gold Member‚Äù and ‚ÄúUptown Girls‚Äù. Brian has been associated with top music artists such as Michael Jackson, Justin Bieber, Britney Spears, Beyonc√©, Rihanna, Celine Dion, Janet Jackson, Prince, Mariah Carey, Usher, P!nK, Nicole Scherzinger, Christina Aguilera, One Direction, Cher and more. Brian was chosen to work with Simon Cowell on several of his highest ranking projects, including judging, choreographing, creative directing, and producing. These shows include ‚ÄúThe X Factor‚Äù (US and UK), America's Got Talent & Britain's Got Talent.\nBrian can be described as a pioneer entrepreneur, having opened his first dance studio at the age of 16. He got his first big break when he starred in the 1992 film ‚ÄúNewsies‚Äù. Soon thereafter, he was one of the breakout stars on the hit show ‚ÄúKids Incorporated‚Äù, alongside Jennifer Love Hewitt and the late Brittany Murphy. He has since worked on ‚ÄúDancing with The Stars‚Äù, ‚ÄúSo You Think You Can Dance‚Äù, ‚ÄúWill & Grace‚Äù, ‚ÄúThat 70‚Äôs Show‚Äù, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, David Letterman, The Ellen Show, Oprah, MTV VMA‚Äôs, VH1 Divas Live, and the Billboard Music Awards to name a few.\nIn addition to spending his time as a Producer, Director, Creative Director, and Choreographer, Brian enjoys giving back to the community. He has toured the world teaching and mentoring thousands of dancers by working alongside The Pulse On Tour, for which he is the Creative Director. Brian also created an interactive instructional dance DVD called ‚ÄúFreestyle‚Äù, teaching audiences around the world original choreography from his most renowned works.\nBrian has never stopped learning, growing and venturing into new fields. He took on the fashion industry as a designer when he partnered with the international company Capezio to create his own Shoe Line called ‚ÄúB-Free‚Äù. This was done before he turned 25 years old. That same love for fashion led him to eventually create a full apparel & shoe line called Brian Says B Free aka BSBF. In addition, Brian currently has a costume collection titled Brian Friedman Performance & a dance wear line called Brian Friedman Dance Wear with Discount Dance Supply. Eventually he started his own online mentorship program called The Talent Collective.

Helene shared her experiences collecting anonymous stories and using punched paper as a medium, while Calvin discussed his preference for art installations and how they allow him to interact with materials and outer space. Both artists emphasised the importance of giving voices to those who are not heard and the universality of suffering and memories.\n\n\n//\n\n\n[hearth] is a community art space initiative by Art Outreach to support independent Singapore-based practitioners with free space and micro-grant funding to create and exhibit their work.

Regardless of the material, the form or the medium employed, Lemmerz' work can generally be characterized by aesthetics of effect. The artworks grasp out and clutch into the surrounding environment and call for more than merely contemplation.\nThere are only a few themes and taboos that are not turned upside down in the Lemmerzian universe, which has been stretched between, on the one side, Kant, Heidegger and other philosophers and authors, and on the other, a mass-media dominated world where suffering and death are central themes in an examination that circles around identity, existence and being.\nLemmerz has pointed out that art has to take effect in the manner of a provocative confrontation. However, as he maintains, art also has to do with experience. And as a matter of fact, sculpture is particularly suitable for establishing a confrontational and experience-exchanging situation, especially when it is perceived from a phenomenological point of view. In such a situation, the sculpture is connected with the (human) body. Just as does the human body in phenomenology, the sculpture enters into relations where the senses interact in such a way that the work can be experienced as a visual and tactile challenge, in the cognitive sense. Instead of being a more or less distanced onlooker, the viewer becomes an active participant, who becomes entangled in new relations and gets moved in some direction or other.\nMusic; Caithness - The Ruins Of Sanctus Magnus", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 384, "publish_time": "20140319"}

This performance by poets Gabriela Gonzales and Christian Ezell is presented in partnership with Southern Word, a non-profit organization which equips young people with the tools to shape, refine, and project their voice and story. Southern Word reached more than 7,500 youth last year by placing writer and music mentors in Tennessee schools and community organizations. \n\nStories saved Gabriela's life, writing has saved her, and so she has a passion for sharing the passion for the written word with young people as a writing mentor.

Using principles of motor learning applied to functional exercise training, exercises were performed while lying, sitting, standing and walking, with the goal of improving intra- and inter-limb coordination in the upper and lower extremities, postural stability and gait pattern. \n\nTwenty-two participants with TBI-related deficits received therapy in a supervised outpatient clinic. Therapy included 20 sessions, each approximately 55 to 60 min in duration, scheduled four to five times a week over four consecutive weeks.\n\nUpon completion of the therapy, participants improved static and dynamic postural stability and gait, evaluated with the Berg Balance Scale (from 45.2 ¬± 5.9 to 49.2 ¬± 4.2 points) and the Functional Gait Assessment (from 22.8 ¬± 4.1 to 26.9 ¬± 3.4 points). They also reduced truncal, upper and lower extremity ataxia, evaluated with the Ataxia Scale (from 7.3 ¬± 4.5 to 5.9 ¬± 4.2 points)\"\n\nFor those interested in the article and/or list of exercises, check out the links below as well as other free educational videos and free home exercise programs here on Little Steps, Big Gains \n\n- Elizabeth \nLsteps.Bgains@gmail.com\n\nOccupational Therapist.

In this video tutorial I give a step by step guide of the whole making process to decorate the Bird Bath made out of Craft Crank stoneware clay using a rhubarb leaf that we made in Part 1 of this Playlist of Videos from the Studio.  This is the second part of a 3-part playlist where I cover all the tips and techniques you will need to make this project.  There is one other videos to come which will explain the glazing and show the finished piece.  Please look out for these videos on my channel via the Bird Bath Playlist.  In this video we make the pinch pot birds and a cheeky little snail to decorate the interior of the leaf to give it more interest.  Pinch pots are probably the earliest form of clay pots ever made and are still useful for some applications today.  So whether you are a beginner or a more experienced potter I hope there is something to learn from this tutorial.  I really hope you may decide to make the whole project.\n\nThe Great Pottery Throwdown on the television has inspired me to share my techniques for this handbuilding project.

I love to share my clay experience and knowledge by passing on pottery techniques in my Pottery Top Tip videos; which include full tutorials on items to try out yourselves. I also sell my work via my Website and Etsy Shop. So grab a cuppa, sit back, relax and let‚Äôs dive into what‚Äôs going on in The Pottery Corner today.

Procreate on IOS is inexpensive and has new animation features (simply turn on Animation Assist in the canvas menu). Adobe Creative Cloud suite is certainly not \"low cost\" but some of you may have access to it for other uses. If that is the case Photoshop and Animate CC both offer powerful animation tools and will be included in your Creative Cloud Membership. I have an in depth, but quite old tutorial for using Photoshop as animation tool here https://vimeo.com/80851591", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 509, "publish_time": "20220523"}

She then removes the crayon resist and pulls a print of the design left on the plate.

Previously he was a faculty member at Purchase College‚ÄìState University of New York for 19 years, where he directed the Media, Society, and the Arts Program. He received his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago; in addition, he did postdoctoral work at both the University of Chicago and Yale University.\n\nAll societies mark off and defend key conceptual boundaries, drawing a line between behavior that is considered to be private or public, sacred or profane, masculine or feminine, for example. However, many contemporary artists, rather then focus on the sublime, delight in smudging the line between such supposedly sacrosanct categories; pollution and corruption‚Äìnot beauty‚Äìbecome both their method and subject. This talk will focus on artistic practice that intentionally destabilizes and contaminates normative expectations, thereby critiquing their legitimacy and challenging their authority. Examples will be drawn from England and America, with a special focus on South African artists: heirs to colonial as well as apartheid legacies of comprehensive systems of containment and control, their symbolic transgressions of taboos, and their emphasis on the abject, critique the status quo and envision novel realities.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

In this comprehensive video, we will uncover the best time of the year to visit Dubai, ensuring you make the most of your trip to this extraordinary city. Whether you're planning a Dubai tour, seeking stunning 4K visuals, or looking for insider tips for your Dubai travel vlog, we've got you covered.\n\nDubai is a city of marvels, where modern skyscrapers, luxurious resorts, and awe-inspiring attractions create an unforgettable experience. But when is the best time to visit this vibrant destination? Let's find out.\n\nFor those who crave pleasant weather and outdoor adventures, the winter months from November to March offer ideal conditions. With average temperatures ranging from the mid-20s to low 30s Celsius (70s to 80s Fahrenheit), you can explore Dubai's iconic landmarks, such as the Burj Khalifa and Palm Jumeirah, without the scorching heat of the summer months. This period is perfect for capturing stunning 4K footage and creating an immersive Dubai travel vlog.\n\nIf you're looking to experience Dubai's cultural festivals and events, consider planning your trip during the cooler months. Dubai hosts the Dubai Shopping Festival (January-February) and Dubai Food Festival (February-March), where you can indulge in world-class shopping, culinary delights, and captivating entertainment.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're a sun-seeker and prefer hotter temperatures, visiting Dubai during the shoulder seasons of spring (April-May) and autumn (September-October) might be ideal for you. During these months, you can still enjoy warm weather, fewer crowds, and potentially find better deals on accommodations and attractions.\n\nSummer in Dubai (June-August) brings scorching temperatures, often exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit). While it can be challenging to explore the city during this time, you can take advantage of the indoor attractions, including the Dubai Mall, Ski Dubai, and the Dubai Aquarium.\n\nTo make the most of your Dubai trip, it's essential to consider the weather, events, and personal preferences. Whether you choose to visit during the cooler months for a comfortable experience or embrace the summer heat for unique adventures, Dubai never fails to mesmerize.\n\nJoin us as we unravel the best time to visit Dubai and guide you through this captivating city. From stunning visuals to valuable insights, this Dubai travel guide is your key to an unforgettable experience.\n\nKeywords: Dubai tour, Dubai 4K, best time to visit Dubai, Dubai trip, Dubai travel vlog, Dubai travel guide, Dubai attractions, Dubai weather, Dubai events, Dubai Shopping Festival, Dubai Food Festival, Burj Khalifa, Palm Jumeirah, Dubai landmarks, indoor attractions, Dubai Mall, Ski Dubai, Dubai Aquarium, travel tips, cultural festivals, iconic city.\n\nAlso watch, \n\nAbu Dhabi desert safari - what to do in Abu Dhabi travel video 4k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDd6gtFSrA\nThe 5 most beautiful places in the united states\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlxEbF-H5CA\n5 best places for visit in the world\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXTrak0kae8\n5 best places to visit northern Pakistan\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0zrKnaRaY\n10 Best Places to Visit in Egypt:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBFVkWpNWpI\nTop 10 tourist attractions in Rome:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej4w9TMZNoE&t=73s\n12 best places to visit in Dubai\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWis7kA-z3w\n\nMy Facebook Page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tourotia/\n\nMy Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tourotia/\n\nMy Tiktok:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@tourotia\n \n#dubai #visitdubai #dubaitravelguide", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 365, "publish_time": "20221211"}

These Character lessons are the ones I wish I learned when I first started out.

And, \"your female characters aren't strong enough.\"\n\nJust before I sold my first book (out of 85 published internationally!) I figured it out. I'm here to share those tips with you, so that I can save you hours of struggling over creating strong female characters.\n\nHere I'm sharing all I learned so you can do this too!

With these emotionally raw images, Vallotton probes the private lives of the bourgeoisie. Revealing scenes usually held behind closed doors, Vallotton‚Äôs prints demonstrate shifting attitudes about sex and morality in fin-de-siecle Paris. They show the pitfalls and struggles of love and relationships by means of theatrical scenes and suggestive titles, such as The Lie, The Money and The Irreparable.\"\n\nRecorded on Thursday, December 9th at 6pm EST.

This is the stuff they never taught you in Pottery School but can be so valuable to jump starting your creativity. BTW, if you notice Ann having trouble with her \"c's\" and \"s's\" its because she lost a tooth in a glazing \"incident\". That's one reason why we've launched the \"Buy a Cup of Coffee\" option below...teeth are expensive and we'd rather spend money on materials to make pottery and videos for you.\n\nAll pieces were made from Standard English Porcelain No. 365\nAnn painted these in the green ware stage. We typically bisque to Cone 04 and fire to Cone 5.\nSEE THE GLAZED RESULTS  HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f4oAQQfogU\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the Ann Tooth Fund (ATF) then please click here: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anneruelA\n\nCheck out Ann's Etsy site where you can purchase pottery made in our videos as well as other thingies: https://www.etsy.com/shop/LittleStreetPottery?ref=seller-platform-mcnav\n\nAnn also creates sought after custom mugs that she paints exclusively for individual clients. If you would like to learn how Ann paints with underglazes  - check out her Video Workshop Series here.  These workshops are very detailed (typically 1.5 - 2 hours in length) where Ann provides step by step instruction and are designed to help potters take their work to new levels of craftsmanship and artistry. https://vimeo.com/showcase/6725318\n\nHere are links to some of the tools we use:\n\nSlip Bottle: https://amzn.to/3LiojnI\nStyrofoam Mold: https://amzn.to/3vUOixt\nHole Punchers: https://amzn.to/3JutWyu\nBrushes Ann Uses: https://amzn.to/3I4E8NI‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã\nThe Car Detail Tape we use: https://amzn.to/3BvjHqZ\nXiem Tools X-Bevel Bevel Cutter for Pottery and Ceramics:\nhttps://amzn.to/3rZnmKi\nHere is the rubber mats we use to make our stamps: https://amzn.to/3etFx3z\nProPlus Sponge: https://amzn.to/3x8Ye50\nBest Red Ribs: https://amzn.to/3sU7qbF\nThe Cameras we use: https://amzn.to/3JJfGCd\nBest Cheap Lens we film with: https://amzn.to/3I6Eljy\nBest Good Lens we film with: https://amzn.to/3s1NuUW\n\n#facets\n#handbuildingpottery\n#pottery\n\nWe use Carving Tools and the Hand EXTRUDERS from our friends at Diamondcore:  https://diamondcoretools.com/?gclid=C...\nWe are not financially compensated by Diamondcore.

Click here: https://www.npr.org/tinydesk\n\nFollow NPR Music:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusic\n\nFeb. 18, 2020 | Sidney Madden -- Almost without trying, Snoh Aalegra has an unforgettable presence. Strolling into NPR's music department on the day of her Tiny Desk Concert debut, the striking Iranian-Swedish singer donned Off-White Nike Dunks, baggy jeans, dewy skin and a sleek ponytail, carrying herself with the kind of camera-ready, cool-girl aura that silenced a mass of people waiting for her. Even with all that, the moment she started to sing is when the real beauty shone through.\n\nLike a fragile candle flame in a pool of melting wax, the texture of Aalegra's voice mesmerizes without overpowering. The 32-year-old has spent years perfecting that balance. Drawing her musical cues from Brandy and Sade while racking up a list of collaborators such as Vince Staples, James Fauntleroy and, most recently Pharrell Williams, Aalegra always finds her groove in the unexpected pockets of emotion. Much of her latest album, 2019's -Ugh, those feels again, is an ode to the comfortability of love, one that's even more appreciated within the close confines of the Tiny Desk.\n\nOn this day in particular, Aalegra's tracks were stripped of their punchier, album-version kick drums and trap echoes. In their absence, it's Aalegra's delicate vocal runs and chemistry with her supporting singers that resonated most. \"I Want You Around\" and \"Whoa,\" which usually rest on a bed of glitchy, spiraling production, felt lighter thanks to the dreamy string section, and by the time she sang her concert closer, \"Find Someone Like You,\" the room was in full swoon. It's clear that at just 16 minutes, Aalegra and her crew knew how to create a memorable moment.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Love Like That\"\n\"I Want You Around\"\n\"Whoa\"\n\"Fool For You\"\n\"Find Someone Like You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nSnoh Aalegra: vocals; O'Neil \"Doctor O\" Palmer: keys; Jef Villaluna: guitar; George \"Spanky\" McCurdy: drums; Ron Poindexter: vocals; Porsha Clay: vocals; Ashley Parham: violin; Johnny Walker, Jr.: cello; Asali McIntyre: violin; Brandon Lewis: viola;  Thaddaeus Tribbett: Bass\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Sidney Madden, Bobby Carter, Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, Patrick Boyd; Editor: Kara Frame; Videographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Jack Corbett, CJ Riculan; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Laura Beltran Villamizar/NPR", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 993, "publish_time": "20200224"}

So, when most people think about political parties they associate them with the common ideologies of the voters and representatives within that party, but the goal of a party is NOT to influence policies. The role of political parties is much simpler: to win control of the government. So today, we‚Äôre going got talk about why we have political parties in the first place and then finish with the five functions they use in reaching that goal. It‚Äôs a lot to cover, so next week we‚Äôll talk about what each political party stands for and how that has changed historically. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 563, "publish_time": "20151205"}

If you're an aspiring animator or simply interested in learning more about the animation process, this video is for you!\n\nDuring this tutorial, we will go through the steps of combining three animation workflows: pose to pose, straight ahead, and layered animation. By blending these techniques, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of how to bring your characters to life in a dynamic and captivating way.\n\nAnimation is a powerful art form that allows you to create movement and tell stories. By utilizing pose to pose animation, you'll be able to plan your scenes with control, focusing on key poses that define the action. Straight ahead animation, on the other hand, provides a more spontaneous and organic approach, perfect for capturing fluid and natural movements. Layered animation allows you to add depth and complexity to your characters, making them visually appealing and multi-dimensional.\n\nSubscribe to my channel for more animation tutorials and tips to take your skills to the next level!\n\nPose to Pose: https://youtu.be/p8Bi7k60IS0\nStraight Ahead: https://youtu.be/fsikGs4ysnA\nLayered: https://youtu.be/cdj0YytsHSI", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 379, "publish_time": "20230821"}

Connecting logical and emotional, individuals and society, art and audience, planet and galaxies, architecture and animation. Even though we often lose touch with the bigger picture, we are all part of a cosmic network. It‚Äôs only the false perception of the human mind that inner and outer are separated, causing confusion and misunderstanding in the world sometimes.\r\n\r\nThe piece is aiming to reopen the dialogue between the internal and external through a cinematic journey from the state of separation to the state of eternal openness. We aimed to draw from contemporary visionary art and architecture, sacred geometry, even physics and chemistry to turn the Palace of Parliament into a vibrant, endlessly beautiful scenery of our symbolic dialogue.

Jennifer uses pageantry and giant puppets to dive into what and who is a culture bearer, the role of the arts throughout human history, how critical artists are and how cultural workers use art to advance social justice. Jennifer Turnbull is a choreographer, performance and teaching artist. Turnbull develops \nart-based curriculum that weaves in concepts of formal education creating relevance and space for self-determination. Jennifer utilizes a lifetime of dance training to create most artwork in collaboration with art family. Collaborations have led to multidisciplinary ensemble performance, dance, music and film projects with SWARM, BARETEETH and other Philadelphia-based artists. The artistic process is a space to get free and hold our liberation as truth. The product is a critique of that which holds us down and apart from each other and ourselves.\n\nJennifer is Co-director of Spiral Q with Liza Goodell where they unleash the power of art to connect people to their collective creative force for change. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

You will see me use acrylic paint as well as watersoluble cryons sometimes called watermedia. I will be painting two paintings at the same time and when they are finished I'll decide which one I like best :)\n\nI use acrylic paint from different brands so my suggestion is to just use your favorite brand. If you want to take your painting to the next level I suggest you try and practise as much as possible. I paint a lot of my paintings on paper which is a nice way to save on expensive canvas and storing the finished paintings don't take up as much space either. I use smooth (hotpress) watercolor paper for  these paintings but you can also use paper made specifically for acrylics.\n\nThe paper I use in the video is 110lb/160gram acid free sketchbook paper. But watercolor paper should work as well.\n\nThroughout this video I will give you my very best painting tips such as; how to keep acrylic paint moist, how to prevent your paint from drying too quickly on your palette, how to keep your colors alive, how to use your photos as inspiration for your finished paintings.\n\nThis painting video is for beginners who want to take their painting beyond the initial first steps and for more experienced artists as well. I hope you got some value, inspiration and tips for your next painting.

I‚Äôve struggled with it from the beginning. At one point in my early piano years, I had to repeat an entire level because my teacher realized I‚Äôd learned nothing. I was hearing her demonstrate the song and then playing from memory, never actually knowing how to read the notes!\n\nAlong the way, I‚Äôve learned some things that have made sight-reading much easier for me, which I'll share in this lesson. As you watch, keep in mind that some people will naturally find sight-reading easier than others. Those of us with strong ears and the natural ability to play without music tend to struggle the most when it comes to reading notation. The reverse is also true for those who are strong sight-readers. Strong sight-readers will often have trouble playing by ear. The important thing to keep in mind is that we all have our own unique strengths and weaknesses and we need to celebrate both.\n\nEnjoy the lesson!\n\nWatch Part 2 HERE:\n‚ñ∫https://youtu.be/Bh4YYNI-bT0\n\n‚ö°Ô∏èChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n1:07 The Treble Clef\n3:10 Middle 'C'\n6:15 The Bass Clef\n7:40 Lesson Review\n\n‚ö°Ô∏èCheck out our FREE piano courses\nGetting Started (your first lessons): https://www.pianote.com/getting-started\nChord Hacks (chording): https://www.pianote.com/chord-hacks \nSight-Reading Made Simple: https://www.pianote.com/sight-reading... \n\n‚ö°Ô∏èFollow us:\n‚ñ∫ Instagram http://instagram.com/pianoteofficial\n‚ñ∫ Facebook http://facebook.com/pianoteofficial\n‚ñ∫ Tiktok https://www.tiktok.com/@pianoteofficial\n\n#readmusic #sheetmusic #musictheory #piano #pianolesson \n‚ö°Ô∏èFollow Lisa:\n‚ñ∫ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lisawittmusic/\n\nABOUT LISA:\nLisa Witt has been teaching piano for +20 years and in that time has helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to play the songs they love.

I was a rare combination of artist and athlete so I moved to Los Angeles in 2008 to play football for USC. I left the team my  sophomore year to focus on painting and filmmaking, applying the same focus and discipline from my football career to my art. I primarily work in oils, and spend most free days painting \"en plein air\" in my new home of Sarasota Florida.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Links in this description might be affiliate links.

Make VIRAL Silicone Squishies from Scratch! Hitohada Gel Tutorial", "description": "‚ô• DIY Transparent Squishies ‚ô• https://youtu.be/PxbOq8whTXI\nEnth√§lt Werbung durch Markennennung / Contains advertisement due to visible brand logos \nThanks everyone for waiting! This DIY took longer than expected because of a delay in getting materials AND the actual crafting process was trickier than I thought ^_^\". I nearly ended up not being able to make this video at all because only one of my DIY squishies worked. But please don't let my experience scare you off from trying this DIY yourself. I made a lot of mistakes in this video so you don't have to, and if you follow the instructions carefully then it should be fairly straightforward! These are things to remember when using Milky Hitohada Gel:\n\n1) The final mixture needs to have a ratio of 3:1, which means 75% Milky Base Resin and 15% Clear Hardener. This should be measured as precisely as possible using baking scales.\n\n2) The mould can be made using 2-part putty or Oyumaru. Of course, you can use any existing silicone moulds as well, such as those for DIY resin casting, DIY clay crafts, cake pops or ice cubes. \n\n3) If adding colour, use a TINY amount of powder pigment and mix this into the base resin. The instructions do warn you that using too much pigment can affect the curing process, which was most likely what happened in my case :(\n\n4) KEEP AWAY FROM WATER. Even a single drop of food colouring is enough to ruin the squishy mixture, so do not use any liquid inks or paint before it's fully cured. \n\n5) Wash your hands repeatedly when handling a freshly-cured squishy. These attract dust & dirt really easily and are very difficult to clean. Unlike pure silicone squishies, washing Hitohada squishies tends to make them stickier. \n\n‚ô• DIY Shopping Links ‚ô•\nHitohada Gel Milky: https://goo.gl/rRzXDS\nHitohada Gel Clear: https://goo.gl/XfR8fS\nHitohada Gel Foamy: https://goo.gl/72XzhX\nOyumaru: https://goo.gl/6ofGLN\n2-Part Mould Maker: http://amzn.to/2gYRLDm\nFimo Polymer Clay: https://goo.gl/Z3H8Mk\n\n‚ô• Ready-Made Squishies ‚ô•\nCat Squishy https://goo.gl/e8ybQw\nSeal Squishy https://goo.gl/nzsaKV\nLazy Squishy https://goo.gl/RqG9dD\nAll Squishies: https://goo.gl/JjqnqU\n\nI have to say I was a bit surprised by how tricky this kit was. I know that Hitohada actually create products for industrial use (e.g. forensics & manufacturing) so it's likely that they simply rebranded some materials for the crafting / DIY market. Most craft products, especially those aimed at children have a high margin of error. Meaning that even if you eyeball the measurements or accidentally add something else, it doesn't make a difference to the outcome. \n\nHowever in this case, getting a measurement wrong by a few grams can make the difference between having a perfect squishy and a completely failed one. This is even more noticeable in my clear squishy DIY. So as mentioned, it's best to treat this project as a very special \"luxury\" crafting experience. If you just want squishies then it's cheaper to buy them. But if you want to try a totally new and unique type of DIY, then give this a try. Polymer clay crafters have a lot of existing pieces lying around, so now it's easy to turn your favourites into squishies! \n\n‚ô• My GERMAN Channel!!

Find out more at http://www.roh.org.uk/mahagonny\n\nThe three-year genesis of Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny (Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny) spanned the entire partnership between Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill ‚Äì one of the most fruitful and shortest musical collaborations of the 20th century. The great success of their first work together, the Mahagonny Songspiel (1927), encouraged the two to adapt it into a full-length opera. But progress stalled as the two men discovered their theories were developing in deeply divergent directions: Brecht eager to pursue the disjointed effect of his theories of epic theatre, Weill looking for ways to unify very different styles of music. Concerns from first the publishers and then producers over the work's 'depravity' further increased the disruption. The riot at the opera's premiere on 9 March 1930 was the beginning of the end of Weill's career in Germany.\n\nThe troubled development of Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny only adds to the work's extraordinary power as one of the most unsettling and provocative of all operas. This is Weill at his most brilliant and inventive, incorporating popular song in the 'Alabama Song' and neoclassicism in the terrifying 'Hurricane fugue'. The Royal Opera's Associate Director of Opera John Fulljames directs The Royal Opera‚Äôs first production of the work in collaboration with designer Es Devlin (Don Giovanni, Les Troyens). They focus on Brecht and Weill's stinging critique of consumerism while finding new relevance in our insatiable depletion of the earth's resources.", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 310, "publish_time": "20150401"}

In this video, I show several examples of how to add surface design to the vases and bowls through the means of additive and subtractive techniques through slabs and sculptural elements, texturing through carving, slip trailing, and carving and sculptural carving.  I made this video for my Ceramics I students at Mason High School.  This is the second exercise (non-graded)  that the kids do in clay for their semester Ceramics I class. They are adding to their learning and building skills they will use throughout the semester. The learning goals are to add surface design to their forms, reinforce the technique of pinching, while adding coils for additional height.  They will learn how to roll round even coils, and score, slip, and blend them to the pinched forms.  They will then learn how to shape the forms, and in some cases, paddle the forms by stretching the clay in the direction they want the form to go.\n\nWe are using Standard 225 for this exercise. It is la grogged midfire light brown stoneware which will be bisque fired and glazed.\n\nCheck out the first video in this series here:  https://youtu.be/ptqAPJ6jNZg\nThe second video which shows the surface design:  https://youtu.be/k1IetOdc04g\nThe third video in which I show the kids how to glaze their forms here:  \nhttps://youtu.be/bWuhJ0ookpo\n\nFor the great tools I used in the video (including the mudtools ribs and needle tools) check out this link to a live Googledoc I continually update with lots of my favorite tools on Amazon using my associate links!  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XbYPQjjJnHrQG5xyWGMHZkEcZj5N8VnUAbFZdJRrRmU/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nHere is a playlist of all the videos for the Ceramics II (slightly more advanced) pinch cups:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj0pNzEmvM_r2nmjBvHwFv-7W9AYfs1LO\n\nI am a public high school ceramics teacher at William Mason High School in Mason, Ohio.

If you wish to purchase your own ink roller (they can be quite reasonably priced) I‚Äôve listed some links below where you can purchase one-\nJackson‚Äôs- https://www.jacksonsart.com/studio/painting-tools/rollers\nHandprinted- https://handprinted.co.uk/collections/rollers\nAmazon- you‚Äôre likely to find similar supplies on here but it‚Äôs recommended to buy from specialist art suppliers\nYou can also use these sites to purchase relief inks.

Producing a clay maquette is often (but not always) step one for starting any stone sculpture. The majority of people thought that this would be relevant information... so here you go!\n\nThis is a video showing the process of creating a low relief of a Northern Cardinal bird. \n\nAfter producing a clay model, mold and a final cast in plaster, one could easily use it as a reference for a stone sculpture, or set up a pointing machine for exact translation into stone. \n\nThis is not a commercial plug, but you can view the final plaster casts we create here: https://www.greenpointstone.com/relief-sculpture.  As you can see, every minute mark shows up in white plaster, so if that is your  final material, it is helpful to use a lighter-tonality clay so you can perceive shadow contrast more clearly.\n\nWe will be creating more long-form tutorials like this for our Patreon subscribers, so if this content interests you, please look into joining our community here: https://www.patreon.com/Sculpting_Stone.\n\nThanks for watching!", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 598, "publish_time": "20200424"}

Organized by the C-MAP Fellows, this year‚Äôs seminar seeks to engage such questions as: What are some of the modes by which specific collectives perform resistance to national narratives? How are artistic and spatial practices employed to perform countermodes of identity, citizenship, or belonging (to a community, diaspora, nation)? What are the challenges faced by self-fashioning practices within architectural histories? How are tensions between local art histories and national narratives interpreted through acts of resistance? Given the relevance of diasporic narratives and aesthetics in times of increasing global displacement and inequality, how can these frameworks be mobilized at our historical juncture?\n\nBranislav Jakovljeviƒá‚Äôs book Alienation Effects: Performance and Self-Management in Yugoslavia 1945-1991 (University of Michigan Press 2016), was the winner of ATHE Outstanding Book Award, and a finalist for AATSEEL 2017 Best Book in Russian Slavic Culture Prize. Jakovljevic publishes widely on subjects ranging from history of modernist theater, to experimental performance, to avant-garde and conceptual art, to contemporary performance. His articles appeared in leading scholarly journals in the United States (Theatre Journal, TDR, PAJ, Art Journal, Theater) and in Europe (Serbia, United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden, Croatia, Poland, and Belgium). He is currently completing a critical edition in English of Radomir Konstantinovic's landmark work The Philosophy of Parochialism (1969).", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 1820, "publish_time": "20190319"}

Are you struggling to make head or tail of the conversation? We can help! Rhona takes you through 12 key project management terms that she thinks everyone involved with projects should know. No longer get confused when confronted with unfamiliar terms like:\n\n1. RAG Status:\n\nThis stands for red, amber and green status.\n\n2. Work Breakdown Structure:\n\nThis is one of the first deliverables of the project, if not THE first.\n\n 3. GANTT Chart or Schedule:\n\nThis is a specific way to visualise the work needed to do to deliver the project.\n\n4. Triple Constraint:\n\nThis is represented by a triangle with cost, time and scope on the vertices and quality in the middle.\n\n5. Methodology:\n\nThis is the framework you use to manage the project. It could be PRINCE2, PMBok, Agile or a combination of them all.\n\n6. Business Case:\n\nThis is the fundamental document for your project.\n\n7. Requirements:\n\nThese are things that must happen or must be produced by the project.\n\n8. Risk:\n\nThis is something that may or may not happen, but if it does happen, it will have a good or a bad effect on the project.\n\n9. Issue:\n\nThis is something that is happening on your project right now!\n\n10. Milestone:\n\nThis is an anchor point on the project management timeline.\n\n11. Stakeholder:\n\nThis is someone, or a group of someone's, who will be directly or indirectly affected by what the project is supposed to be delivering.\n\n12. Steering Committee:\n\nThis is a group of people that have been tasked with providing strategic guidance to the project and are there to support the project manager.\n\nRemember, if you're looking for a tool to help you manage your portfolios, programmes and projects check out Psoda at https://www.psoda.com/global/\n\n#projectmanagement #terms #tips", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 315, "publish_time": "20171122"}

I'll also show you the inspiration behind the painting and how I choose the colors. \n\nI use only 2 colors of acrylic paint and they are: Burnt Sienna, Ultramarine Blue + Titanium White and Black. I also use some watersoluble cryons and watercolor pencils.\nThe paper is 160lb/200gram acid free sketchbook paper. But watercolor paper would work fine as well.\n\nIf you want to take your painting to the next level I suggest you try and practise as much and often as possible. I paint a lot of my paintings on paper which is a nice way to save on expensive canvas and storing the finished paintings don't take up as much space either.\n\nThis painting video is for beginners who want to take their painting beyond the initial first steps and for more experienced artists as well. I hope you got some value, inspiration and tips for your next painting. \n\nSome of my other abstract landscape painting tutorials :\nLandscape with 3 COLORS ONLY: https://youtu.be/hplRTxy5AUw \nModern Abstract Landscape: https://youtu.be/cwzJ1JQOzGA\nAtmospheric Landscape Tutorial: https://youtu.be/0l5yeKrxt8o\nDramatic Sky Tutorial: https://youtu.be/m5I2YSBaR_Q\n\nIf you would like to support the channel you can buy me coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheDanishPainter\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#TheDanishPainter #LandscapePainting #PaintingTutorial", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 572, "publish_time": "20210220"}

In this video, I am showing what I have available in my school studio for my students to try if they want to on their Pick A Passion Project.  We have Laguna B-mix no grog, cone ‚Öö  and PSH 450i Black clay, cone 6.  I show the marbling and wedging in this video, as well as making a slab and cutting it in half for slab building.\n\nHere is my playlist for handbuilding with marbled or agate clays:\n\nHere is my playlist on agateware and marbled clays for throwing:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj0pNzEmvM_o8d3Ds87hHDAVcWWh0aKT0\n\nI am using a table which is covered with heavy canvas.  The canvas allows the clay to release from the porous surface, as opposed to working directly on the formica top which would cause it to stick.  The canvas must be diligently cleaned after use with water, as it really holds dust.  The taller wedging table to the right in the video is a plaster filled top, covered with canvas.  I find it better in concept than in practicality, as it is just too tall for me to comfortably use.  If you are 6‚Äô tall, it is probably a perfect height for you.  Many potters I know use Hardibacker Board for their wedging surface- as it is sturdy, durable, and yet somewhat absorbant to release the clay from sticking.  Other potters I know highly recommend using a birch plywood wood surface which is not sealed as a wedging surface.  All surfaces should be cleaned well with water when done to avoid unhealthy dust. \n\nCheck out my Amazon Influencer Store where I have recommendations for some of my favorite tools and products many of which I use in my videos- which are available on Amazon.  https://www.amazon.com/shop/karanspotsandglass\n\nFor the great tools I used in the video (including the MKM rollers and the wooden Kemper  tools) check out this link to a live Googledoc I continually update with lots of my favorite tools on Amazon using my associate links!  (also some non-amazon suggestions on here!)\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1XbYPQjjJnHrQG5xyWGMHZkEcZj5N8VnUAbFZdJRrRmU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nI always recommend purchasing from your local pottery supplier- as they are the knowledgable ones that are there when you need them.  I can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things about Cornell Studio Supply in Dayton- they provide service, education, and a beautiful selection of materials to potters and educational institutions in Ohio and the surrounding areas!  https://cornellstudiosupply.com/product/540i-black-clay-psh/\n\nI am a public high school ceramics teacher at William Mason High School in Mason, Ohio.  (Mason is currently the largest high school in Ohio!)  As a potter, I have been working in clay for over 30 years, and  I have been teaching for over 30 years, the past 22 have been specifically teaching high school ceramics.  I love what I do!  I have my own studio in my home basement, where I work on my personal pottery for my Etsy site;  https://www.etsy.com/shop/KaransPotsAndGlass\n\nI started my Youtube channel to make videos to help my students if they are absent and miss a demo, or if they would like to explore more advanced techniques independently.  I have been amazed to reach such a wider audience than my own students!\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel if you would like to receive channel updates, or would like to learn more about clay and studio processes!", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 317, "publish_time": "20210504"}

You will see in the intro how each technique looks after the piece is completely finished so you can decide which method will work best for you! The first piece we use as an example was made by our own host, Kara Lane, and the second was made by the wonderful and accomplished potter, Birthe Flexner.

In our second class I'll explain the three biggest ideas in Animation and how they can help you use all the other principles more easily. Hope you enjoy!\n\nAlso a small correction, I incorrectly named the producer of the example film Lost and Found as Lucy Haynes when in fact her name is Lucy Hayes. Apologies about that, and thanks again to the team for letting me share their work here. \n \nA note on software:\nWe don't touch on software in this class because I believe there are already lots of great tutorials out there but if you're interested in low cost options to get started there are a few that come to mind- Blender is a free 3D package and includes a \"Grease Pencil\" mode if you're interested in learning 2D animation. Procreate on IOS is inexpensive and has new animation features (simply turn on Animation Assist in the canvas menu). Adobe Creative Cloud suite is certainly not \"low cost\" but some of you may have access to it for other uses. If that is the case Photoshop and Animate CC both offer powerful animation tools and will be included in your Creative Cloud Membership. I have an in depth, but quite old tutorial for using Photoshop as animation tool here https://vimeo.com/80851591", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 438, "publish_time": "20220421"}

Joshua Lisec, Ghostwriter of over 45 books, shares manuscript submissions tips that work.\n\nSo you want to know how to submit a book for publishing. But are there even publishers accepting submissions right now?\n\nYou've probably heard of the Big 5 publishers - Simon & Schuster, Macmillan Publishing, Hachette Book Group, Pengiun Random House, and Harpercollins Publishers. Can you just google \"publisher submissions,\" \"book submissions,\" or \"novel submissions,\" visit the Big Five Publishers' contact pages, and submit a manuscript?\n\nIt's not that easy. Pengiun Random House submissions, Harpercollins submissions, Harpercollins imprints' submissions, and Macmillan submissions are all the same: \"No Unsolicited Submissions.\" So what's that mean?\n\nMost publishers' manuscript submission guidelines have you first get a literary agent, who takes care of the publishing submissions process on your behalf, whether you're working on a nonfiction book or have a novel manuscript submission.\n\nYou could look up smaller, independent presses on Publishers Marketplace, but the Big 5 publishers typically offer the best book advances and best book deals, even to first-time authors.\n\nIn this video, Celebrity Ghostwriter Joshua Lisec tells you everything you need to know about manuscript submissions, answering \"how to find a publisher for my first book\" once and for all!\n\nüìöüí∞üöÄ\n\nStill working on a book idea?

We explain how the idea of a complex line integral arises naturally from real definite integrals via Riemann sums, and we examine some of the properties of this new sort of integral. In particular, we consider some complications that arise when trying to apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to complex functions.\n\nWe then bring these ideas to the central focus of this series: the zeta function and the Riemann hypothesis. By the end of the video, we will be able to use complex integrals to approximate the location of the zeroes of the zeta function (or those of any other complex function for that matter)!\n\n--\n\nPlease subscribe for more content like this!

The composition is a homogeneous mixture of overtones of only one tone. The music is limited to only eight overtones, which are repeated almost continuously in the exact same ascending sequence. Through the repetition of melodies and intervals, the piece takes the listener almost into a meditative state.\n\nThis composition was created in the framework of an AGYA music workshop. Musicologist and AGYA member Rami Chahin gathered a diverse ensemble of composers and musicians from Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Palestine, Poland, and Syria who ventured a contemporary interpretation of traditional Arab maqamat. As a result, five innovative pieces of contemporary music compositions have been recorded.

If you are willing to spend just 5 minutes a day, you can Master Sight-Reading With These 6 Tips! \n\nSight-reading is one of the most challenging skills facing the pianist and I think these tips can help anyone become a better sight-reader. Piano tips. \n\nThanks for watching and make sure and SUBSCRIBE for new content every week: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWpiCo9qbJt4NyqzZdVILBg\n\nInquiries about online piano lessons with Craig via Skype can be sent to craig@craigsmusiclessons.com\n\nTip number 1 is to sight-read daily. Even if this means only for five minutes, that's fine! Music is a language and like other languages it's very difficult to learn if it's not something you do daily. \n\n\n tip number 2, don't look at your hands. Now this is the number one mistake that I see most people making. \n\n tip number 3 Make sure to keep a steady beat. This is also a common mistake. Because half of sight reading is reading rhythms, it is very important to make sure that the rhythm is precisely accurate. In fact I think that the hardest part about sight reading is reading The rhythms. \n\n tip number 4 is Learn to recognize patterns. You probably won't be surprised to know that there are many many recognizable patterns in most music. In fact many pieces follow predictable harmonic and scalar patterns. Being able to recognize these patterns is essential to becoming a good sight reader. If you have to look at every single chord and slowly figure out what each note is, rather than instantly recognizing that it's a C chord in 1st inversion, then it will be very difficult for you to sight-read  Fluently. Recognizing chord and scale patterns is essential to being able to sight read fluently.\n\nTip number 5 is Always be looking at least one measure ahead of where you are Where ever possible.\n\n Tip number  6 is  Don't worry about the wrong notes.  Oftentimes people are so worried about playing wrong notes that they end up stopping and hesitating constantly throughout a piece that they‚Äôre sight reading. This habit  will make it very difficult to Sight-read fluently. Even if you only play half of the notes correctly, keep going!\n\n\n#pianolesson #pianotechnique #newpiece #practicing #pianopractice #sightreading", "quality": "1920x1080", "duration": 367, "publish_time": "20200612"}
